And just make the format compatible throughout the transition period:\n\n1. Add extra metadata/diagnostics per test result, keep writing benchmarkRun records.\n2. On results processor, start reading the data per test result, ignore benchmarkRun records.\n3. Stop emitting the benchmarkRun records.",

Not exactly the same, but shouldn\u0027t matter much either.\n- benchmarkInterrupted: not needed; just report True if there were any unexpected SKIPs.\n\nSo really all we need are diagnostics.
