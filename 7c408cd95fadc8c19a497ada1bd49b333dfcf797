If that\u0027s the case, well, we just skip adding that option (where not supported) and let the caller filter by PID instead. \n\nRelated, see crbug.com/686716#c15 for some more context.\n\nBut please double check this logic and try with some devices on at least a couple Android versions. Also please extend the compatibility tests in https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/device_utils_devicetest.py?rcl\u003d1bae362e77893f0fe040098b1c4694e8c5bcb4d3\u0026l\u003d235 which do run on real devices.",
