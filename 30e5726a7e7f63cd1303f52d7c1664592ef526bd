      "message": "That\u0027s a good question. Are there any alerts generated on the count and/or sum of the measures in a HistogramSet today? If there are, then I\u0027d be happy to add those to the list. It seems those aren\u0027t stats we could be matching for when alerting, as we mostly seem to be looking at mean and standard deviation in the anomaly detection algorithm. I find it a little hard to think about whether we will do anomaly detection on just the count or just sum of the measures.\n\nLooking at https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/dashboard/dashboard/find_anomalies.py I can\u0027t tell easily whether alerting on count or sum of measures in the histogram would yield useful alerts/anomalies for sheriffs. Did you have specific use-cases for it?",

      "message": "Looking at the alerts page and sheriff configs, there don\u0027t seem to be any defined on _count that I saw, although I really only looked at the Chromium Perf Sheriff. There was a single alert on _sum, and a few alert definitions that specifically looked for sum.\n\nI don\u0027t have specific use cases for it myself, more noticed that the list didn\u0027t match the list I\u0027m used to seeing in code in other places.\n\nStill LGTM whether you decide to include either of them or punt.",
