It\u0027s also rumored to be a json string (again, nothing actually enforces this because Python) according to the docs so you\u0027ll probably want to parse it and handle parser exceptions fist before doing anything else with its contents.\n\nAs far as how to get `repro` out of the json contents, I think that\u0027ll depend on how this gets invoked from steps in third_party/catapult/dashboard/sandwich_verification/sandwich-verification-workflow.yaml but Eduardo might have a more specific answer",
