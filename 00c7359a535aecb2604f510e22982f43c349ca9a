      "message": "This will fix that bug I mentioned with the persistent shell not working with the --avd-config command to the test runner. This change could theoretically also go in avd.py here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:build/android/pylib/local/emulator/avd.py;drc\u003dd4322adbeb5febf69a7bd0d3c16030fe6ced65e5;l\u003d742\n\nBasically for a few seconds the adb devices will return \"emulator-xxxx offline\", but since a serial number emulator-xxxx is returned, the code will continue and try to setup an persistent shell connection and will cause failures when attempting to read.",
