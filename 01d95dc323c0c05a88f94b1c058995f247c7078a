I have flashed some and ran some quick tests. It seems working fine. See the tasks in https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/bot?id\u003dbuild339-m4--device6\nSince vbmeta.img and dtbo.img are not in the compiled output, I don\u0027t think they are required for Pixel 1.\n\n\u003e Beats me. I haven\u0027t flashed a phone in ages. You\u0027re far more familiar with this now than me :-)\nIf they are not required for Pixel 2, you probably would not add them in the first place :) So I would prefer keeping them. Plus I don\u0027t have a Pixel 2 at my hand so verifying it locally would be difficult. WDYT?",
