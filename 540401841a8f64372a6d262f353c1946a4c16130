      "message": "I was digging through our logs to see how frequently this occurs, and it looks like it happens more often that I had anticipated (over 500 in the last week, spotty from April 9th onwards). However, when spot checking a few of those restarted jobs, they seem to be in limbo (ie/ https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/10d7833e3e0000, https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/173ea74e3e0000 or https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/12f2074abe0000 where the job looks done (by done, i mean completed or errored), but the status is now \"in queue\").\n\nBased on that, and on the premise these jobs went into a limbo state because of the missing pubsub, I think this is safe to land.
