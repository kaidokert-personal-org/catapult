Or at least have some way to differentiate (maybe different colors?)\n\nHaving at least the primary display covers at least 90% of the use-cases (for me at least), and is a big improvement about not seeing any vblanks on the timeline.\n\nIf someone thinks multi-display vsyncs would be useful I can have a closer look at the vsync_auditor code and try to add this.  But I only have a setup to test this with linux/drm.",
