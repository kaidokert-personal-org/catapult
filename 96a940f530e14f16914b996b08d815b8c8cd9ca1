IIUC:\n\n- cli/gRPC users can now request identical build specs (git hash + patch) in both \"changes\" for a pinpoint job\n- New \"label\" field is used by downstream processes (e.g. analysis) to differentiate between the two changes given that they\u0027re otherwise identical from just build spec\n- New \"args\" field is passed to the test runner (and/or browser executable) and can be different for \"base\" and \"exp\" changes\n\nIs there a higher-level discussion (if it\u0027s just the linked bug, I guess I\u0027ll follow up there) about the problem this solves?",
