      "message": "IIRC the instructions do say to place this after the `\u003chead\u003e` element, but I think they mean after the opening tag (i.e. *inside* the `\u003chead\u003e` element, before the `\u003c/head\u003e` tag).  \n\nAt least, that\u0027s what I had to do for the skia perf templates in order to get it to render properly on the server side.  That may have been just a server-side issue with sanitization features of go\u0027s `text/template/html` package though.\n\nEither way, if you haven\u0027t verified it already just be sure that this does get inserted into the document and actually executes on the client side.",
