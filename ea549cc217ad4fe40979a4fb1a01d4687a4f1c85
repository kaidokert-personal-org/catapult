      "message": "IIUC (biiiig assumption ;) the race condition is something like \n\n```\n   Thread 1               | Thread 2             | ndb op | job.cancelled, as\n   handle /run            | handle /cancel       |        | stored in ndb\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0: job \u003d key.get()        |                      | read   | false\n1: job.Run()              |                      |        | false\n2:                        | job \u003d key.get()      | read   | false\n3:                        | job.Cancel()         |        | false\n4: [never updates its     |                      |        | false\n   copy of job.cancelled] |                      |        | false\n5:                        | job.cancelled \u003d true |        | true\n6:                        | job.put()            | write  | true\n7: [its in-mem copy of    |                      |        | true\n   job.cancelled is still |                      |        | true\n   false]                 |                      |        | true\n8: job.put()              |                      | write  | false\n```\n\nI believe that adding an IsCancelled (even if it\u0027s @ndb.transactional) check here would be like having Thread 1 do an extra read somewhere arbitrarily in the range of lines (1, 8). This would still leave Thread 1 potentially unaware of any writes that Thread 2 has made before Thread 1 reaches line 8.\n\nI\u0027m not familiar enough with ndb transactions yet to answer this, but can the entire /run and /cancel handlers be made atomic? E.g. make it so either request thread\u0027s key.get() call will block or raise if the other thread already has read the key with a txn (locked job) and hasn\u0027t committed the txn (released job) yet? Or something like that?\n\nBacking up a bit, what do we *want* to happen if a user asks the server to cancel a job that\u0027s already started? If it\u0027s \"Reply with a `sorry, we can\u0027t actually cancel a job once it\u0027s started` message and disable the cancel button.\" that\u0027s probably easier than \"Actually have the server cancel the job and stop any distributed work already in progress on it.\"",

      "message": "Wow nice visual. \n\nFirst, we want to first see if we can \"fix\" the cancel button. We would like it if when you press the cancel button, the job somehow stops. If that\u0027s not possible, then we\u0027ll go with the alternative of showing an error message that says \"sorry, jobs only cancel if they are queued and not running\" \n\nSecond, I believe everything you said about threads, ndb op, and job.cancelled are correct. I am hoping that scheduler will track the job objects and their queued / running / cancelled status correctly regardless of race condition. Scheduler does not get overwritten by job.run (I think otherwise this solution would not work). \n\nThird, I don\u0027t know enough about ndb transactions either to know if it\u0027s possible to prevent threads from running while other functions are executing.",

      "message": "After thinking more about this, I now believe this CL does fix the race condition (except for a caveat that I\u0027ll mention below). The reason is job cancellation is recorded in two places: the cancelled flag in the Job object, and the removal of the job from scheduler\u0027s ConfigurationQueue object. The race condition causes Job.cancelled flag to be overwritten, so that it remains False after the Cancel method is called. However, the change to the ConfigurationQueue is persisted, since that update is protected by a transaction, and job.put() doesn\u0027t make any changes to the ConfigurationQueue. So even when the race condition occurs, scheduler.IsCancelled(self) will still return True, and the new \"if\" statement will correctly stop the job from running further.\n\nThe caveat is Job.cancelled flag will remain False. I\u0027m not sure what the Pinpoint UI will display as the status of the job, but likely not \"Cancelled\". We should add another statement below, before raising the exception, to reset self.cancelled to True.",
