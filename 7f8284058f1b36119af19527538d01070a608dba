      "message": "We\u0027re using this importer in standard telemetry code, in fact I was fixing a couple of cases in a test named telemetry.timeline.model_unittest.TimelineModelIntegrationTests (testGetFirstRendererThread_singleTab, testGetFirstRendererThread_multipleTabs, testGetTrace). The cases in the test are failing in our environment where the tests are run on virtual machines on Windows. The cause of a failure as I think is as follows:\n\n1) The virtual machine does not have high resolution timer enabled\n2) The trace code inside Chromium is generating \"nestable instant\" events instead of nestable start/end pairs in this environment because the time slice generated by the test code has zero duration when measured by low resolution clock\n3) Nestable instant event is not handled in trace importer code which yields to test failure.\n\nI believe we will transition to perfetto traces right after upstream does it, but for now the task is to fix the test code.",
