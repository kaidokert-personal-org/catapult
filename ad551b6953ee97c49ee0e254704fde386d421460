      "message": "This feels dangerous to me. Somebody could easily add a new handler without thinking about access control.\nWould it make sense to either require subclasses to override this (Explicit is better than implicit), or else make it restrictive by default (better safe than sorry)?\n\nEither way, please add a comment about what this method does, how it may raise some types of errors, and how subclasses should override it. It may be \"private\" (protected), but it\u0027s an important part of the API.",
