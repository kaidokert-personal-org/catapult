      "message": "We\u0027ve generally preferred to let Pinpoint manage running retries and repeats (1 iteration per Attempt). There are a few reasons:\n* Perf tests (and flaky tests) are frequently not independent. We want each repeat to run in a separate Swarming task to separate them.\n* We can shard/parallelize the tasks.\n* We can amortize the bias of individual devices across the larger pool.\n* Error handling is simpler. Pinpoint doesn\u0027t have a notion of \"this Execution partially failed and partially passed.\"",
