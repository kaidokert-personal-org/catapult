      "message": "It occurred to me a bit ago that we\u0027re probably over-complicating this, and you can probably just compare timestamps. If, when we download something, we set it to the download time, that\u0027ll *always* be newer than the timestamp of the sha1, and if we then update the timestamp of the sha1, *most* of the time that\u0027ll mean that we should redownload the file.\n\nThis is, of course, how ninja builds work, and so it\u0027s a fairly safe (but not foolproof) assumption. \n\nDoes that make sense? If so, I think we should probably do that just to be consistent with how we determine \"correct\" elsewhere.",
