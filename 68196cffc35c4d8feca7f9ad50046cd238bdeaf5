      "message": "Seems fine to me, the less we have to do ourselves (and the more we can rely on the sdk) the better.\n\nThe only concern is older versions/images. If this were to land, could it still be used to flash older images on older devices?\n\nThe docs technically say devil \"supports SDK level 16 and above\" (whcih would be J):\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/catapult/devil/README.md\n\nI don\u0027t actually know how true that is. But if this change means we can only flash M and newer, we may want to update those docs.",
