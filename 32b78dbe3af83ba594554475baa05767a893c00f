However, I don\u0027t see any evidence that the underlying data problem has been fixed, so adding the assert now might just cause Dashboard to crash at runtime.

I think you\u0027ll likely get support for removing usages of six and other obsolete modules from directories such as telemetry, tracing, devil, etc. However, there will likely be resistance to any large scale changes to dashboard directory. Also, I\u0027d recommend against any semantic changes (such as adding assert) to dashboard.\n\nIn any case, I appreciate your help to improve Catapult code base.",
