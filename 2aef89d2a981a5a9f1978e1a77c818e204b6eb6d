      "message": "yep, clarified that tag keys do not have to be unique in the design doc.\n\nnote that the proto uses {\"key\": key, \"value\": value} instead of colon-separated string, but i am not opposed to colon-separated. I think we will be using colon-separated string internally anyway, and a single string is easier than a dict. What are your thoughts on this?",

      "message": "Don\u0027t have a strong preference either.\n\nLeaning a bit *slightly* towards making them dicts, because that seems a bit more \"semantically accurate\", and there is no \"parsing\" involved to later extract the values.\n\nBut the amount of parsing is trivial anyway, and I can also see the case being made for a more compact representation.\n\nSo, don\u0027t know. Happy to go either way. :)\n\nAny thoughts Mikhail?",
