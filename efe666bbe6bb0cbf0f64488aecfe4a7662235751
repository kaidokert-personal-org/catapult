      "message": "Hi Rohan,\n\nIs it possible to remove this assert here or setting the cwd argument when calling RunCmdOnDevice?\n\nTake service_name as ui for example, there is a chance that the command\n`sh -c status ui` gives expected results in stdout, that contains string like \u0027running, process\u0027, but stderr contains \u0027No such file or directory\u0027 that comes from the `sh`.\n\nIt looks like this method could ignore the stderr and simply return the indicator of the service running. wdyt?\n\nThanks!",
