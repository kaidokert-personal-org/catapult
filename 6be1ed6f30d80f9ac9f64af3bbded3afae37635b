      "message": "It seems like you\u0027re using \u0027test_base_dir\u0027 the same way you were using \u0027test_name + test_basename\u0027 before. The name \u0027test_base_dir\u0027 suggested to me that it\u0027s independent of the actual test name, so this is a bit confusing. Also, it\u0027s confusing because I don\u0027t know why you would want that to be optional if it\u0027s supposed to reflect a per-test thing, but I suppose maybe if you\u0027re using content-addressed paths it might be shared?\n\nIn retrospect, this feels awkward and we should probably keep working on the API, but we can go with this for now.",

      "message": "I included it as a way to segregate test artifacts by test name in the output directory for python unit tests.  I can change the variable to test_name, so that it is more obvious that test name should be passed for this argument. Also, I want it to be optional so that I can use this class to create and track artifacts for web tests.",
