      "message": "I think it is not required to check if it is loading a main frame here since we filter out such navigation start events already. I retained this just to be safer, since we usually fetch the snapshot corresponding to the fmpEvent. In my understanding if navigationStart is reported as a main frame event (snapshot.args.isLoadingMainFrame is true and the url !\u003d\u003d \u0027\u0027) then fmpEvent also should have the same property. I am happy to remove this check if you also think it is unnecessary.",
