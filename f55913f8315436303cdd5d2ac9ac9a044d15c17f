      "message": "I\u0027m concerned that this will significantly increase number of repeats (attempts) at each commit position. The new high threshold will be 0.6 or higher. When there are no perf differences, there is still at least 60% chance for p-value to be below new_high_threshold, likely resulting in UNKNOWN comparison result. This will trigger more repeats. However, without any real perf differences, repeats will not necessarily have large impact on p-value, so Pinpoint may keep getting UNKNOWN result and keep increasing repeats. (The old code mitigates this by reducing high_threshold as number of repeats increases.)\n\nHave this CL been validated on staging? I would feel more comfortable if we can try this CL out with multiple scenarios on staging.",
