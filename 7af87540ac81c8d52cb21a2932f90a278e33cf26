      "message": "Hi Brian\n\nThis CL reverts changes to some telemetry unittests which removed multiprocessing in the tests. This\nshould make telemetry stop carrying state to other tests. We can reland these changes in another\nCL after fixing the issues in the bug.\n\nPTAL\nRegards\nRakib Hasan",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this revert is necessary - we should be able to get equivalent behavior by resetting the artifact implementation after every test. It\u0027s a bug that that\u0027s not currently done, as it assumes that test hermeticness (hermeticism?) is handled elsewhere (in this case, because it\u0027s in a different process).",
