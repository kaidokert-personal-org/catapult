      "message": "I think if we\u0027re going to be consistent, then we always add the test prefix prior to loading a test by name, e.g.:\n\nelif not name in found:\n  found.add(name)\n  add_tests(loader.loadTestsFromName(self.args.test_name_prefix + name)\n\nI think this means you don\u0027t need self.test_name_to_id, either, and all of the changes in this file get simpler?",

      "message": "I agree with removing the dictionary of all the test names from the _Child object, because that dictionary would need to be serialized for every test run and that would add multiply a factor of N to the time complexity of running the tests. However when running telemetry unit tests, tests may have different prefixes, therefore by adding the prefix to every name, you would not be able to run tests that do not have the test_name_prefix as its prefix.",

      "message": "If the caller doesn\u0027t set the test-name-prefix, then you would be prepending \"\" that is correct. My intention was for the test-name-prefix was to only prepend to tests that have the prefix in its fully qualified name (\"tests.TestA.test_pass\"), when the test-name-prefix is set to a non empty string. It seems that you want the test-name-prefix to be prepended to all test names for consistency. This still works for gpu tests, because you can only run one test class at a time. In my next patch I will add the test-prefix to every test name.",
