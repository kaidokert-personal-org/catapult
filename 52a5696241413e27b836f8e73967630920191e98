Looking at the documentation of sys.exc_info() it sounds like this has always been the case (the trace stops at the calling stack \"handling\" the exception, so our try-raise-except has always just one frame).\n\nLooking at clients, other than unittests, there are only two places where we call this with a string:\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/web_perf/timeline_based_measurement.py?rcl\u003de7298f36f7912f2caa122086cfbe71734d04b73f\u0026l\u003d314\n[2]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/internal/story_runner.py?rcl\u003de7298f36f7912f2caa122086cfbe71734d04b73f\u0026l\u003d225\n\nFor [1] it seems that just printing the string is what we really want; for [2] I\u0027m not even sure if doing that instead of raising an exception there is the right thing.\n\nUnless Ned has any other thoughts, my vote would be to remove the useless 1-frame traceback when converting from a string, and just decorate it with something like e.g. \"Failure recorded: {message}\".",
