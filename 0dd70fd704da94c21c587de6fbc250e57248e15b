      "message": "So this looks a bit frustrating.  At first it seems like this is easy: there\u0027s a Google-provided Dataflow template to perform batch deletions on the result of a GQL query, and it\u0027s straightforward to schedule that to run daily or hourly or whatever via Cloud Scheduler.\n\nBut there\u0027s one piece missing: GQL has no CURRENT_DATETIME function equivalent!  So there\u0027s no way I can see to write a query relative to the current time, just a hard-coded literal time.  So we can\u0027t simply rely on timestamps to query for expired tokens.\n\nWe can could easily enough query by state, e.g.:\n\n  SELECT __key__ FROM `Token` WHERE state IN (2, 3);\n\nBut I\u0027m assuming this would be more aggressive than we want.  What\u0027s the intended lifetime of e.g. a COMPLETED token entity?\n\nWe should also consider the advice in https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/best-practices#deletions, which suggests that naive solutions may be unwise.",

What\u0027s the intended lifetime of e.g. a COMPLETED token entity?\n\nWe don\u0027t provide an SLO on that, but given the current expiration of 10m, it\u0027s not going to be very long. If we\u0027re running the deletion every 3 hours I\u0027m fine with that spread of delay (anywhere between 0 to 3 hours). Even if it\u0027s a 24H delay I suspect we can live with that.\n\nThe only real concern for us is the storage cost. If we wait too long, we\u0027ll be generating a lot of tokens, and it will take longer to cleanup the tokens too.",
