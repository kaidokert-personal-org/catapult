      "message": "Not a blocker for this CL, but have we looked at writing this functionality from scratch in Go? If not possible, please look at moving this endpoint into the skia-bridge service. This adds a dependency on the legacy pinpoint service which will block deprecation of the legacy service in the future. Skia-Bridge is meant to provide integration points between the skia infra and chromeperf so it will be good to have all these apis in one location. If we will have a replacement for this in a few months that\u0027s fine but we do not want this dependency long term.",
