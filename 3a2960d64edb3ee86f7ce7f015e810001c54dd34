      "message": "I thought this mitigation is enough to avoid excessive pushing:\n1. device.PushChangedFiles() would md5sum both sides and would only push if there is mismatch\n2. _InstallCacheClearingTool() has @decorators.Cache which means once the tool is pushed, subsequent calls of _InstallCacheClearingTool() on the same AndroidPlatformBackend instance would assume everything is installed and would skip even the md5sum step.\n\nIs this not enough or my reading is incorrect?\n\nRenaming to _InstallCacheClearingToolIfNeeded() is a good idea, will do.",
