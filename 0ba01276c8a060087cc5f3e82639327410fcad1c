      "message": "I\u0027m not confident about that either :) So, how might a `regression` object make it this far into the AlertGroupWorkflow update process without having a `benchmark_name` or `bot_name` set on it? \n\nIn the end, if you cover that possibility with unit tests then at least you\u0027re doing no *worse* than what the rest of this codebase does.\n\n[I can\u0027t tell from reading this code (because Python...) what type `regression` actually is, or who can potentially create or modify it before it gets to this method. Sprinkling defensive checks like you describe throughout this logic is probably not a terrible idea given this codebase\u0027s history, but yeesh. When/where do you stop adding them? Eventually you reach a point where you\u0027ve implemented a really buggy and brittle type checker that\u0027s over-constrained to your app\u0027s implementation details. And we\u0027d have gotten a far less cumbersome way to guarantee these properties, for free, if we just rewrote this in some other language... maybe next year...\u003c/soap-box\u003e]",
