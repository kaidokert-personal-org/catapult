      "message": "This takes a lot of mental load to figure out why we\u0027re splitting the test path by the first four \"/\"\u0027s: presumably, the first is the bot, the next the benchmark name, the next the story name, and the next the metric name? So is the deal that we\u0027re dropping the bot name and returning something akin to \n\n[\"power.idle_platform\", \"idle_story_10s\", \"story:power_avg\", 7.2]?\n\nOne thing that\u0027s tough here is that we\u0027re returning a \"Timeseries data point\", but that\u0027s not really defined anywhere that I can tell. Maybe it would help to give an example of what that looks like?",
