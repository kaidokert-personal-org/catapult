But I also think it would be nice if we force clients to only be able to set the tbm metrics in a single place once. So I would suggest.\n\n- replace AddTbmMetric with SetTbmMetrics(metrics) where you set self._tbm_metrics \u003d tuple(metrics), and complain if metrics were already set.\n- let this property as is, callers now get a tuple they cannot change. :)",

Converting it to a tuple and then back to a list seems pretty strange to me, to be honest, so perhaps we can leave it a list?\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/tracing/tracing/metrics/metric_runner.py?l\u003d29",
