      "message": "This is exposing the inner list which callers might accidentally mutate. But I also think it would be nice if we force clients to only be able to set the tbm metrics in a single place once. So I would suggest.\n\n- replace AddTbmMetric with SetTbmMetrics(metrics) where you set self._tbm_metrics \u003d tuple(metrics), and complain if metrics were already set.\n- let this property as is, callers now get a tuple they cannot change. :)",
