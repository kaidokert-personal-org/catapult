      "message": "I sometimes use all of _min, _max, _std (see, for example, [1]). I don\u0027t look at them (or monitor) in the dashboard usually, but in the results (e.g. local runs, or pinpoint results). We also removed some _discrepancy metrics since we get the _std results anyway.\n\nI don\u0027t find the extra entries in the dashboard dropdown distracting, to be honest (perhaps I have just got used to them). And the new dashboard [2] does not even list them separately. So I don\u0027t think having these extra entries is a problem we need to address.\n\n[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1255152#message-3f28ace10d2e8c011016e02f9d18a91cbfd40985\n[2] https://v2spa-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com",
