      "message": "I like very much the power that comes from:\n\n  commit.FromUrl and patch.FromUrl\n\nI also like the *.FromRequest methods, although the name is not great. Maybe FromAny, FromData?\n\nOther alternatives for naming:\n\n- Keep AsDict only, but on commit/patch the AsDict is magical and if passed a string it will try to parse it as a URL.\n- Keep a single public AsData only (or something like that), which calls private _FromUrl or _FromDict as needed.\n\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nThe one I do not like very much is change.FromUrls, or any functionality like that that tries to build a change with multiple commits/patches from a single unstructured string. A change.FromUrl would be fine, but if a client needs to supply multiple urls at that point they should probably supply a dict with more explicit structure instead, right? Wdyt?",
