      "message": "This is a follow up to https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/catapult/+/2670248.\n\nIt computes cumulative layout shift across all renderer processes. That means it computes cumulative layout shift for all navigations in benchmarks that have multiple navigations. We don\u0027t have plans for multi-navigation cluster telemetry cases, and for regression testing use cases I think this should be okay (the default approach would be a sample for each navigation, but the dashboard would show a summarized view of that anyway).",

      "message": "That SGTM. I think for dashboard in a multi-navigation story, what you probably want to plot is the average of each navigation\u0027s total CLS. Currently it\u0027s going to plot the sum of the each navigation\u0027s total CLS. Implementing that will definitely require figuring out the frame/process tree, so we can do that when we need regression testing for this on the dashboard.",
