That means it computes cumulative layout shift for all navigations in benchmarks that have multiple navigations. We don\u0027t have plans for multi-navigation cluster telemetry cases, and for regression testing use cases I think this should be okay (the default approach would be a sample for each navigation, but the dashboard would show a summarized view of that anyway).",
