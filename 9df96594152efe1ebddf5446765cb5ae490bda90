      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure I\u0027m following what these checks are doing, and I feel like doing\nboth things in a single function is contributing to the confusion.\n\nIf I have this straight: \u0027check_file_tags_against_reference\u0027 ensures that you\u0027ve declared all of the tags that are actually used? And \u0027check_tags_in_file\u0027 ensures that you actually use every tag you declared?\n\nIf I have the latter one right, that makes me a bit nervous as a check, because I would expect it to be somewhat common that you\u0027d declare some tags but not always use them.\n\nI might change the names to be \u0027require_all_tags_to_be_declared\u0027 and \u0027require_all_tags_to_be_used\u0027 or something like that. \n\nI\u0027m not also not sure why you\u0027d ever want check_file_tags_against_reference to be False?",
