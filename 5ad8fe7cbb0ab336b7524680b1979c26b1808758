      "message": "Another high level comment, I think it\u0027s a bit ugly all this passing around of the extra flag everywhere through all methods until you reach the flag changer o browser start.\n\nI can think of a couple other alternatives:\n\na) Have each the FlagChanger and BrowserBackend have a private class attribute, e.g. \"_detailed_logs\" or something like that, which starts as True, but is set to False after the first large command line flag has been emitted.\n\nb) Add a new detailed_logs attribute to browser_options, which is already wired through most of the methods where you need to pass this extra flag.\n\nBoth of these suggestions have their own ugliness to them, so don\u0027t think there is a clear winner; but wanted at least to throw out some more possible ideas.",

      "message": "Agree that this is a bit ugly.\n\na) Typ has a feature where output is only produced for failing tests. It does this by intercepting output during a test run and only printing it if the test fails. For typ-based tests, my current changelist is what they want since it doesn\u0027t turn off any output, so when things fail they will get all the logged information that they want. If we used a private class attribute, then they would only get full output if the first test failed.\n\nb) Using browser_options does sound reasonable. I know the negative is that browser_options is used for too much stuff, but I still think this is better than the alternative ugliness that my current changelist exhibits.",
