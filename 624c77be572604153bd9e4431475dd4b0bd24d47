      "message": "I thought about this, but checking for the correct interned data would require parsing protobufs, which is not implemented so far.\n\nThe other option is to mock all proto-writing out and test for the correct methods to be called. But I feel doubtful about mock-tests in general, in my experience they never help to prevent errors, just make it harder to refactor anything.",
