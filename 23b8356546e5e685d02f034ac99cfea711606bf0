Otherwise a reader might think these are for the fuchsia.git repo (which is different).\n\nCould you also add comments to say that these are for Git commit IDs for the public and Google-internal integration.git repos?  (Even if there are no existing comments for these fields, this is a good time to start adding some. :-) )",
