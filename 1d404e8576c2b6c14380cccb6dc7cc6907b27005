In this case...do we need to use oauth2client to do the lock check? Do we need gsutil to do the check? Can we add a retry to catapult?\n\n2) Try to upstream the relevant change, and then do pull the changes down.\n\n3) Make a change to the third_party repo, and document the change in the README.chromium.",
