      "message": "Thanks for looking into this!\n\nWe generally try not to make changes to third_party repos, it causes O(n) merge conflicts in the future.\n\nUsually we try to [in order of preference]:\n1) Make a modification to the way we use third_party libraries. In this case...do we need to use oauth2client to do the lock check? Do we need gsutil to do the check? Can we add a retry to catapult?\n\n2) Try to upstream the relevant change, and then do pull the changes down.\n\n3) Make a change to the third_party repo, and document the change in the README.chromium.",

So it may not be a good idea to depend on it yet since it may not have undergone as much testing as full release versions.\n\n#3 I can document the change.",

      "message": "I did #3.\n\nAlso, for #1, adding the retry to catapult is a bad idea because \na. this fix is needed for other code as well: anything that uses\ngsutil would need this retry\nb. the retry would be fairly complicated because I wouldn\u0027t want\nto retry by default i.e. for any failure because that is generally\nbad practice. So I would have to do string matching to know whether\nto retry, and that\u0027s pretty messy. The gsutil command by default\ndoesn\u0027t pass back detailed information about failures.\nc. Sometimes the gsutil call affects state so we could get into a\nweird state.... retries aren\u0027t generally very nice.",
