In this case...do we need to use oauth2client to do the lock check? Do we need gsutil to do the check? Can we add a retry to catapult?\n\n2) Try to upstream the relevant change, and then do pull the changes down.\n\n3) Make a change to the third_party repo, and document the change in the README.chromium.",

The check is performed in order to get credentials to download tracing files that the test needs.\n\n#2 the real fix is already upstreamed, but it\u0027s not a \"release\" version yet. So it may not be a good idea to depend on it yet since it may not have undergone as much testing as full release versions.\n\n#3 I can document the change.",
