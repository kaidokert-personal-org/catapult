      "message": "This is going to consume a huge amount of memory!\nCan you see if the layer tree quad stack view contains enough math to factor out an R-tree?\nIf not, please consider implementing an R-tree for this. Otherwise, I\u0027m concerned that this metric will OOM. Traces already consume a huge amount of memory.\nThere\u0027s an R-tree in src/cc/base, it might be quicker to emscripten that.\n\nIf implementing an R-tree in js or emscripten-ing the one in cc/base is too much trouble for this experiment, please consider down-sampling. That will at least give you a constant that you can tune to balance accuracy vs OOMs.",
