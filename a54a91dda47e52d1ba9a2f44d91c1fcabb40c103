      "message": "It was because of the tests. If I didn\u0027t make a copy then, when checking for the mock.call args, there was no way to distinguish between the dict values on the first and the second Request call (because they were the same dict!).\n\nHowever I agree that was a bit odd. So I rewrote the test to use a little RequestStub so it\u0027s more clear and less surprising now.",
