      "message": "The fact that we depend on this looks scary. I am guessing we need this to clear the interning dicts?\n\nA short term solution is to expose a \"clear\" or \"reset\" module level function to call on the perfetto_trace_writter module. Then call that on a setUp method for this TestCase class.\n\nThe other more complicated but also cleaner one would be to refactor that perfetto_trace_writter module into a Factory/Builder object, so you keep the interning state in instance objects instead of global vars.\n\nWdyt?",
