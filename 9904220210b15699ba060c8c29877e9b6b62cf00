      "message": "But that\u0027s not what\u0027s causing the task to fail, is it? Rather it\u0027s the timed out `rm -rf` commands, which are still being logged regardless of this CL. ie:\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/4NnBtsWQWed.png\n\nSo how would this CL help in that case? What other avenues of investigation does this CL open for you that the base logging currently doesn\u0027t?\n\nDevil is already excessively verbose when it comes to certain failure modes. So I\u0027m hesitant to add even more without proof that it would indeed help.",

(More examples can be found in crbug.com/1093602)\nIt is possible that an adb shell command did not ever end and thus block all the rest shell command from executing.\nSo it is important to understand if there is any common pattern, like if it always starts failing with the same shell command (could be `getprop`).\n\nSuch timeout occurs occasionally in Emulator, on both MM and Pie. It hurts the stabilization a lot. But it is very hard to reproduce locally. This CL would help understand the root cause.",
