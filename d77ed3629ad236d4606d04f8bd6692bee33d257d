How many changes does a user have to make to the job configuration before it\u0027s considered a \"different\" job? \n\nFor example, if a user modifies the story or git hashes, the default attempt count will stay the same as the restarting job. In most cases, I think this logic is fine, but if you can think of a case that would be unintuitive for a user, please let me know.",
