      "message": "Hi Brian,\n\nThis simplifies the logic and makes it clear that a local apk is required for most of `PossibleAndroidBrowser.UpdateExecutableIfNeeded`. Technically all of it since it\u0027s not really meaningful to have a valid _support_apk_list but no _local_apk, but in case someone does... I\u0027ll leave that assumption alone. ðŸ˜„\n\nThanks,\nPeter",
