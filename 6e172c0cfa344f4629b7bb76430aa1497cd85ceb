      "message": "Does this mean the ScrollAction will no longer work on Chrome 83 and below? That can be a problem, as we run all perf tests against both current ToT build as well as against a reference build (currently m78). Will all perf tests that use ScrollAction stop working with the reference build? It might be necessary for scroll.js to handle both old and new browsers.\n\n+Wenbin to double check my understanding.",

      "message": "I thought the perf tests are running on the ToT only. If it is also running on a version lower than M84, it will not work. My purpose here is to delete the old GpuBenchmarking.SmoothScrollBy, so we only have GpuBenchmarking.SmoothScrollByXY. If I cannot do it right now, so I guess I have to wait until you update the reference build to M84.",
