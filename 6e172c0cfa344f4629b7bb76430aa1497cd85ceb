That can be a problem, as we run all perf tests against both current ToT build as well as against a reference build (currently m78). Will all perf tests that use ScrollAction stop working with the reference build? It might be necessary for scroll.js to handle both old and new browsers.\n\n+Wenbin to double check my understanding.",
