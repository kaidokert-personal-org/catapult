      "message": "This file was written in the \"top-to-bottom\" style, meaning that main() starts at the top of the file, and then functions come after it in the order that they\u0027re mentioned (more or less). Ideally this ends up with functions being located close to where they\u0027re first used.\n\nCan we move these further down into the file, closer to where they\u0027re called? I\u0027d move this below the TestSet definition, and the other four down below _default_classifier.",
