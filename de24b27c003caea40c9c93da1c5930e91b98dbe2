See this best practices doc for background: https://engdoc.corp.google.com/eng/doc/tott/episodes/598.md?cl\u003dhead\n\nI think that you should try to avoid used complicated logic in unit tests because we don\u0027t write unit tests for unit tests so we don\u0027t really know if they are working or not. Why not just do a simple string comparison here so we don\u0027t need to split the argument pieces?",
