The target page doesn\u0027t do `TE: chunked`, but still streams back the response.\n\n\u003e I would also suggest we add an argument to try this behavior to RecordCommand and ReplayCommand in wpr.go for allowHttpStream or something similar to gate this while we work on it.\n\nThanks. I think that also allows us to mark the archive format as experimental and make changes to it until we are sure.",
