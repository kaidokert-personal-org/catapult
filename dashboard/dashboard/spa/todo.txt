merge updateObject with setState?
use string statePaths with Polymer.Path.get()?
ChartSection testPathComponents observer call maybeLoadTimeseries
should TestPathComponent etc dispatch ChromeperfApp.actions?
change NEW_STATE to a static method. maybe action creator?
newState methods for all elements
