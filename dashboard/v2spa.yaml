# While V2SPA is under development, this configuration is deployed to
# v2spa-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/
# This configuration serves a vulcanized HTML file at / and some of the same
# request handlers as V1.
# The V1 dashboard described in app.yaml continues to be deployed to
# chromeperf.appspot.com
# When V2SPA launches fully, app.yaml can be removed, and this configuration can
# be deployed to chromeperf.appspot.com
# See also v2spa_dev.yaml, which is only meant to be run with dev_appserver.py
# locally, and not deployed even to a dev instance.
