Can we just pre-install it on the bot and ask that you have it in your path or something if you want to run locally? We do that with gcloud.\n\nOtherwise, this leaves a stray binary in dashboard/bin, could be either cleaned up or gitignored I suppose. When I tried this locally on my linux cloudtop, cipd failed complaining it was already in a site root.",
