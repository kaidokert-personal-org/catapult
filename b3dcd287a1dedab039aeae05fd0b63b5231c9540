      "message": "After this refactor it became even more apparent to me that the right place for this forwarder to live is _within_ the DevToolsClientBackend, as it created specifically to connect to it, and their lifetimes should be tied together (i.e. when closing the devtools_client one should also close the forwarder).\n\nNed, if you agree with this, I\u0027ll file a bug to move the forwarder into the devtools_client as a follow up.",

      "message": "As I chatted off thread with Ned, this is the test I could write, however I feel it\u0027s pretty hacky. Also needs us to remove the connection check in the \"do nothing forwarder\", as that would fail even before we even get to try to ping the agent to see if it\u0027s ready.\n\nSo maybe just don\u0027t add this test?",
