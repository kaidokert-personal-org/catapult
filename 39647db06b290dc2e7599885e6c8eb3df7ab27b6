      "message": "My high-level thought here: it feels wrong for StoryExpectations to know anything about how the expectations are passed in (in this case, from the parser), and the fact that we have \"GetBenchmarkExpectationsFromParser\" feels like we\u0027re running into a leaky abstraction here. \n\nIt made sense before that there was no way to set a benchmark\u0027s _expectations field from outside of the benchmark because it was expected that each benchmark would define its own GetExpectations() method internally. However, now that an external thing is responsible for controlling the expectations, it seems like we need some glue code that\u0027s extracting the expectations from the parser and assigning them to the benchmarks. nednguyen@google.com, do you agree? Do you have any feeling on where this code should go?",
