      "message": "+benhenry, +ushesh: I want your feedback on these.\n\nStill going a bit back and forth with the names. Some of the things I\u0027m thinking are:\n\n- Whether we want to completely replace the existing Health:* reports, currently based on\n  memory.top_10_mobile, or keep both sets at least for a while.\n  (Note this is in v2spa only, reports on the legacy health dashboard will remain and\n  remain based on memory.top_10_mobile.)\n\n- Initially we _can_ provide reports based on these internal bots, so I named the reports\n  \"Android Go (Internal)\" and \"Nexus 5 (Internal)\". However, when upstream bots start\n  building clank and the relevant devices are added, the plan is to switch to \"Android Go\"\n  (no longer \"Internal\") and \"Pixel 2\". So this naming should allow us to have a bit of\n  overlap of downstream/upstream bots during the transition period.",
