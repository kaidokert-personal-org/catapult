However, in the following build https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/Android%20FYI%20Release%20(Samsung%20A23)/45/overview, in which the roll of this is in the blamelist, the tests fail earlier, complaining about being unable to root the device. This is because `--compatibility-mode\u003ddont-require-rooted-device` is not being properly forwarded to where it\u0027s used in android_platform_backend.py anymore https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/internal/platform/android_platform_backend.py;l\u003d163?q\u003dandroid_platform_backend.py (`finder_options.browser_options.compatibility_mode` is an empty list)",
