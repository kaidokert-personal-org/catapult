      "message": "I wonder if we should avoid sideloading in recent (R) builds and just use the built-in one? Otherwise we might end up accidentally disabling the built-in perfetto if someone runs this on their personal device. The obvious downside is that we might start depending on something from a more recent service which your device might not support.\n\nEdit: now that I noticed you\u0027re restarting the built-in service perhaps this is fine, but let me leave this comment here for your thoughts anyway",

This could also be a cause of slowly disabling perfetto on anyone who uses telemetry.\n\nDo we have some catch all exception area where we can ensure we restore the system service?",
