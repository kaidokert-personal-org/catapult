      "message": "Wenbin pointed out that one issue with the way I\u0027m fetching the improvement direction is that if a bisection kicked off without generating tags in the arguments dict, then it\u0027s possible to get an unknown improvement direction even if the improvement direction is known. \n\nWe talked about hacking together the self.tags[\"test_path\"] using the other arguments (project, configuration, benchmark, story, and chart) but the issue with doing that is if the configuration is a PGO config, then some editing is required. I\u0027m also not sure that this method would scale well if new bots are added in and they follow their own naming convention.\n\nI think I\u0027d rather deal figure out the best way to get the improvement direction in a different CL. It\u0027s possible the optimal solution is to force pinpoint to generate self.tags[\"test_path\"] every time. ",
