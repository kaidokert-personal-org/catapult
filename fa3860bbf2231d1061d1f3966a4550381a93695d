      "message": "The basic idea of this patch seems fine, but you need to use the methods on the \u0027host\u0027 object (and the fake_host) object in order to talk to the filesystem / environment / issue http requests / etc, rather than using `mock` and the associated libraries.\n\nIt\u0027s debatable whether the host approach is the right one (vs. using mock + direct access), but for now we should use host for consistency with the rest of the code.\n\nI would also prefer to avoid using the `requests` library if we only need it for the one call; it adds a rather large dependency on typ just for that.",
