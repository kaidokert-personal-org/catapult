      "message": "I would disagree that these tests don\u0027t test anything. They are intended to verify @exc_util.BestEffort decorator, which is supposed to suppress new exception when another exception is already been handled. For example, in testTryRaisesExceptRaises, if @exc_util.BestEffort isn\u0027t working properly, the final exception would be FakeDisconnectionError instead of FakeConnectionError, causing the test to fail.\n\nAm I missing something?",
