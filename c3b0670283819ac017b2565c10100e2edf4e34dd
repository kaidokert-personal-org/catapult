The only interesting thing I found is that in the pm dumpsys command output:\n\n      User 0: ceDataInode\u003d0 installed\u003dfalse hidden\u003dfalse suspended\u003dfalse stopped\u003dtrue notLaunched\u003dtrue enabled\u003d1 instant\u003dfalse\n\nnote \"installed\u003dfalse\"  so I\u0027m assuming that pm path won\u0027t show anything with installed set to false, how it got to that way I don\u0027t know.",
