      "message": "It\u0027s possible that urllib3 or requests set different sockopts. When I was debugging blink_web_tests for crbug.com/1141606, I observed that\n- urllib2 created a connection for each of the post request, \n- +100 of TIME_WAIT socket were in the output of netstat, and\n- the entire test performance seemed to be very slow.\n\nDepending on the socket buffer size, many of TIME_WAIT sockets can slow down the entire system performance because it occupies kernel spaces. I suspected that TIME_WAIT socket was costier in Window 7 than Ubuntu.\n\nMy gut feeling is that urllib3 is possibly setting a different sockopt or shutting down the socket instead of close() conditionally or magically. Thus, urllib3 on Mac could reduce # of TIME_WAIT sockets created in certain conditions.\n\nI\u0027m sorry that I am giving you uncertain information, but I couldn\u0027t debug any deeper it was a Windows vm. Perhaps, you have more tools on Mac. Could you run those and check TIME_WAIT sockets?",
