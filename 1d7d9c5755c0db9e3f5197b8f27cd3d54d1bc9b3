      "message": "Does the catapult team think this is a good idea? Performance regression emails are often very confusing today, because the title changes make it hard to track which emails are updating each bug.\n\nThis might not be the best format, but I really think that arranging to have the regression count isolated is helpful.",

I feel like we should get some input from the Buganizer team as well, as we can change titles on bugs as well and that could cause Gmail to restart the thread.\n\nFor now we can try how your change works. This could be a guidance for the future changes.",

      "message": "Excellent, thank you! Yes - it seems like there are things that could be done on the buganizer side, too. I originally filed b/338585437, then I read go/gmr-faq#threading, and decided to try and fix this problem here. I think this will help, but it does seem like buganizer should try to use header metadata to enforce threading of bug udpates, even when the title changes.",
