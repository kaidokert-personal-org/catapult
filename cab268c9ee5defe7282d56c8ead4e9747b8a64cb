      "message": "PTAL - changed the approach a bit after John Chen responded to the team chat thread about this issue.\n\nChanges since previous LGTMs: \n- started from original base commit and did a find-and-replace `assertCountEquals` -\u003e `assertEquals` in alert_group_workflow.py\n- updated the mock issue service implementation to sort issue labels before saving the recorded method call.  They were getting re-ordered randomly (I\u0027m guessing due to being converted to sets and then back to lists)\n- updated asserts to include actual formatted comment text instead of `mock.ANY` (which does not seem to work with `self.assertEquals(...)` as one may expect - the asserts always failed because `mock.ANY` wasn\u0027t considered equal to the text in the other half of the comparsion. /shrug...)",
