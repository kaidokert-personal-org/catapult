      "message": "PTAL - changed the approach a bit after John Chen responded to the team chat thread about this issue.\n\nChanges since previous LGTMs: \n- started from original base commit and did a find-and-replace `assertCountEquals` -\u003e `assertEquals` in alert_group_workflow.py\n- updated the mock issue service implementation to sort issue labels before saving the recorded method call.  They were getting re-ordered randomly (I\u0027m guessing due to being converted to sets and then back to lists)\n- updated asserts to include actual formatted comment text instead of `mock.ANY` (which does not seem to work with `self.assertEquals(...)` as one may expect - the asserts always failed because `mock.ANY` wasn\u0027t considered equal to the text in the other half of the comparsion. /shrug...)",

      "message": "\u003e mock.ANY (which does not seem to work with self.assertEquals(...)\n\nThis is strange. mock.ANY is supposed to work with self.assertEqual. It defines a custom equal operator that always returns True (see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/catapult/third_party/mock/mock.py;l\u003d1938).\n\nI tried the following code snippet, and it succeeded as expected:\n\n```\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest import mock\nunittest.TestCase().assertEqual({\u0027a\u0027: \u0027A\u0027, \u0027b\u0027: \u0027B\u0027}, {\u0027a\u0027: \u0027A\u0027, \u0027b\u0027: mock.ANY})\n```\n\nReplace `mock.ANY` by anything other than `\u0027B\u0027`, then the assert fails.\n\nCould you please double check?",
