      "message": "If we\u0027re just running into issues with install, then I\u0027d prefer if we confined it to that for now.\n\nFor every one execution of these methods on a dev\u0027s workstation, the same thing gets executed 100s and prob 1000s of times on the bots. And a few of those instances are likely running on misbehaving devices that exhaust all retries + timeouts. So my concern is that we\u0027d be increasing the time-to-fail in those worst cases.\n\nThough of course, bots are meant to be abused. So if we have evidence that a flat bump like this will improve dev\u0027s lives, then I wouldn\u0027t be opposed :)",
