      "message": "johnchen@, I discovered after the roll that when I implemented the DevTools methods a year ago, I had decided to send an error message upon metadata retrieval attempt if the origin wasn\u0027t found (instead of sending some default metadata object). I had forgotten about that.\n\nHere, I don\u0027t want that particular case to raise an error, so I add in a way to handle it (create a default metadata object to suit the purpose), along with tests for this case.\n\nApologies. PTAL. Thanks!",
