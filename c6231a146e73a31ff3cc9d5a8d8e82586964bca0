      "message": "I\u0027m not a huge fan of this style of test where all actual testing is deferred to a separate method in order to save code because it generally violates the principle of completeness for unit tests (see http://shortn/_YGWpILZCey). Before, the unit tests were simple enough (and were only asserting one thing), so it was generally fine, although I probably should have said something before.\n\nGenerally, I like to be able to look at a unit test and decide if what it\u0027s doing even makes sense without having to look in other methods. For example, it wasn\u0027t until I unwound this test that I realized that this test case was just making an assertion directly on the parameter that was passed in.\n\nI totally agree that the patching in Python is kind of ugly, but I think the minimal amount of patching probably doesn\u0027t justify the lack of clarity that we get by moving everything into a helper method. Given that, I\u0027d really prefer if you ditched _RunTest and just did the testing inline, e.g.\n\n  def testUnsupportedAndroid(self):\n    possible_browser \u003d FakePossibleBrowser(\n        FakeAndroidPlatformBackend(version_codes.OREO))\n\n    with mock.patch(\n        \u0027telemetry.internal.browser.browser_interval_profiling_controller\u0027\n        \u0027._AndroidController\u0027) as android_controller_mock:\n      controller \u003d profiling_mod.BrowserIntervalProfilingController(\n          possible_browser, \u0027\u0027, periods\u003d[\u0027period1\u0027], frequency\u003d1)\n      with controller.SamplePeriod(\u0027period1\u0027, None):\n        pass\n      \n      self.assertEqual(android_controller_mock.call_count, 0)",
