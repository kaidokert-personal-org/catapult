Name: funcsigs
URL: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/funcsigs
Version: 1.0.2
License: Apache License 2.0

Description:
funcsigs is a backport of the PEP 362 function signature features from
Python 3.3's inspect module. The backport is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7
as well as 3.3 and up. 3.2 was supported by version 0.4, but with setuptools and
pip no longer supporting 3.2, we cannot make any statement about 3.2
compatibility.

Local Modifications:
Removed everything except for the core source files (including setup script and
documentation).
