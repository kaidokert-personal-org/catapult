In contrast, timed message that you have to cancel in 3 seconds might not give enough time.\n\nI\u0027m also wary of spending time implementing that popup: it\u0027s definitely something that I should be able to figure out, but `alert` has a simple blocking API and timed popup will require me to learn how to do all of that in Polymer",
