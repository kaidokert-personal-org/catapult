Waiting 2 min for the report to fully load does not sound reasonable.\n\nWhy can\u0027t we have a periodic job on the server precomputing the summary metrics needed for reports; so we are then able to serve them immediately when trying to view the page with the report?\n\nThis probably needs a design doc before more coding, and close collaboration with +yfriedman, +benmason and myself; as this tool will be central to a potential new \"system health rotation\" we\u0027re hoping to bootstrap.",
