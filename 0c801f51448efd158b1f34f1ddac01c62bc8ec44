      "message": "I think they shouldn\u0027t be overlapping. Though I am not sure if duration should be 0 since the Blink_Layout_UpdateLayout reports 60 duration in the args. I think it should be 60. These are blink runtime call stats hence adding adithyas@ who actually added them. \nadithyas@ what do you think is the right fix?",

      "message": "Ah I see, this was my mistake initially, I didn\u0027t account for the previous \u0027toplevel\u0027 slice overlapping.\n\ndproy@: Can you change this slice to have a start time of 13552 and duration of 1000 and the next one to have a start time of 13555 and a duration of 990? I think that should fix the existing overlap issue and make the slices resemble what real slices would look like.",
