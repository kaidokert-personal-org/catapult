      "message": "Echoing a similar offline chat with Weizhong:\n- yes we technically could modify the tests. However, I worry about 1) ownership of the tests (would anyone object to us changing them?) and 2) I\u0027ve seen variants that pass HTML-like data into the test, in which case the spaces are required\n- another option would be to avoid this whole problem by saying \"Chromium can\u0027t support spaces in variants\" and we just skip importing these tests altogether. Main downside is we lose coverage\n- third option is to do the eng work to support both cases and move between them.",
