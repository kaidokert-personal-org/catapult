They are added to steps on the loop starting at line 265. I think could do something like\n\n   if args.platform \u003d\u003d \u0027android\u0027 and not args.run_android_tests:\n     steps \u003d []\n   ...\n   with open(args.output_json, \u0027w\u0027) as outfile:\n     json.dump(steps, outfile)\n\nto completely disable all steps for android bots.",
