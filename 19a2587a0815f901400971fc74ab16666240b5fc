Trying to disable that warning also did not work, probably because of https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/59 which got fixed on pylint 2.0, but pylint on depot_tools is still at 1.4.1.\n\nI also tried to provide a more useful error message; but finder_options has an old-style class with nothing useful on __name__ (just reports \"instance\" rather than \"FinderOptions\"). So I settled with this. Hopefully you think it\u0027s not terrible?",
