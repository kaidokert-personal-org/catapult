      "message": "Yeah, it appears to be. Though the errors are pretty obscure. (Why would adding a new wheel to the python venv environment cause that?)\n\nIt could be that the wheel here is different from the protoc version we install on these bots:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/build/+/master:recipes/recipes/catapult.py;drc\u003df946f76947daa884a89e3c6ea922be6cedb8bf0f;l\u003d71\n\nI tried bumping that version and patched that into a led run with this CL:\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/swarming/task/50007bc2f57f4310?server\u003dchromium-swarm.appspot.com\n\nLet\u0027s see if that fixes it? If not, I\u0027ll have to think about this some more.",
