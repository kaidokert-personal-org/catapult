I\u0027m happy to do reviews at a higher priority if there\u0027s consensus that this is what we want for the long term (which I think we do).\n\nI understand this might be technical debt but we already have a pile of technical debt we need to deal with anyway. As long as this change is going to unblock users that need it now then I\u0027m fine with accepting some of the technical debt. The longer-term transition to py3 must happen and that must include using something supported like vpython and/or depot_tools -- even if it means we\u0027ll require independent users of catapult to pull in those dependencies moving forward.",

It sounds like we\u0027re all generally in consensus of moving off the vendored six.\n\nAfter speaking with Weizhong, he\u0027s agreed to take over crbug.com/1007101 from John and finish out the migration. ie: moving devil users in chromium to vpython and tearing out sys.path manipulations from devil. And in the meantime, we can move forward with this + Weizhong\u0027s other devil CLs to unblock the weblayer fyi builder.\n\nDoes that sound OK with everyone?
