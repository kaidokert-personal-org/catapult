      "message": "+1 for nit ClearCaches().\n\nQuestion: what are the reasons for clearing caches at PossibleBrowser creation? We want to do it in some stories anyway. Is this for predictability?\n\nSuggestion: @staticmethod or gust a global function? Since we are only delegating work to |platform| here, I don\u0027t see value in the flexibility to override this method in descendants. On the negative side, it adds an indirection which complicates reading the code.",
