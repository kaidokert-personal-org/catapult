Thank you.\n\nThe Chrome side change is here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2944526\n\nHow long could this telemetry change be applied to the chromium-review build bots? Is it real time once this CL is submitted? Or I have to wait a few days for the bots to pick up the latest code?\n\nBest regards,\nNancy",
