With the eventual goal of having chromium being able to better control it\u0027s emitting of these histograms.\n\nAs a part of this we shifted the histogram delta calculation to chromium. Which makes the path in uma_metric.html unnecessary. So this change removes that portion of the code.\n\nCould you PTAL?\n\nThanks,\nJonathan",
