I have a TODO below at line 77 to fix this.\n\nI think \":\" won\u0027t work for us because some of our story names are e.g. \"browse:social:facebook\".  In the old format it looks like currently we do an awkward (and not very consistent) mix of \".\" and \"/\", e.g. for smoke tests they currently look like:\n\n    benchmarks.system_health_smoke_test.SystemHealthBenchmarkSmokeTest.system_health.memory_mobile/load:news:washingtonpost\n\nTo be honest \"|\" is probably a better choice for a separator as people are less likely to be \"already using it\" as part of their name \"atoms\". For us the above would become:\n\n  benchmarks|system_health_smoke_test|SystemHealthBenchmarkSmokeTest|system_health.memory_mobile|load:news:washingtonpost\n\nAlternatively you could force us to stick within some \"allowed set of chars\" for those name atoms, and that would give us an excuse to clean up our names (e.g. stop using URLs as names in some old benchmarks). Of course that will also involve migrations in dashboards consuming the data, so not a trivial task either.",
