      "message": "high level comment here: I think that a few high-level tests are necessary in a browser_simpleperf_controller_test file in order to give us confidence that this isn\u0027t going to blow stuff up:\n\n- On Android, make sure that this class does nothing if an empty `periods` parameter is passed in\n- On Android, make sure that the right traces are recorded if a non-empty `periods` parameter is passed in\n- On Windows, Mac, and Linux, make sure that the test still runs successfully if no `periods` parameter is used\n- On Windows, Mac, and Linux, make sure that the test still runs successfully if a `periods` parameter is used\n\nIt seems like, with these tests, we can be confident that submitting this CL won\u0027t blow up the CQ and the world.\n\nWriting these tests could potentially be a pain in the butt, but will likely go really quickly (\u003c1h) assuming that you have the right example to work from. I\u0027m going to talk w/ Ned to find out what a good example of this type of test would be.",
