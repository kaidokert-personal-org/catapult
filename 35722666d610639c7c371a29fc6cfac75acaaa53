In case\n[1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 10]\nIf we pick 2 as the change point in first iteration, the original partition is\n[*1, *1, *1]\n[*2, *8, 10, *10, *10]\nSo because the limitation of min_segment_size (items with star), we can\u0027t pick 8. And the minimal extendency should be \n[*1, *1, 1, *2, *8]\n[*1, *2, 8, 10, *10, *10]\nYou can see extending min_segment_size for left and (min_segment_size - 1) for right is enough and it prevents choosing any point as a change point in the intersection of left and right or pre-picked change point (Which is important for ensuring algorithm terminated at some point).",
