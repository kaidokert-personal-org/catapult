      "message": "I\u0027m not a big fan of this solution but I could not think of another way.\n\nTo me, the use cases are:\n```\nUser journey 1:\n- pinpoint loads default 10 iterations\n- user edits attempt count\n- user edits benchmark (should not overwrite)\n\nUser journey 2:\n- pinpoint loads default 10 iterations\n- user edits benchmark (should overwrite)\n- user revises attempt count (should overwrite)\n\nUser journey 3:\n- on a job page, user restarts job (should load previous attempt count)\n- then either UJ1 or UJ2\n```\n\nThe issue with this is if a user sets it to mac-m1 + speedometer2 (attempt count \u003d 30) and then changes their mind and decides to run system_health.memory_desktop, then the iteration count will remain at 30 even though the default for that benchmark is 10.\n\nWould appreciate any ideas you have.",
