So then it\u0027s basically a garbage char, and we\u0027re not doing comprehensive cleanup/validation of the name to ensure it\u0027s comprised only of valid url chars and not too long and such anyway. So, I thought it ok to punt on # but am open to being more comprehensive now if you think warranted.",
