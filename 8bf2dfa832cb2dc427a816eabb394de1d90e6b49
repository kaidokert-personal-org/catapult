My understanding is once the log file is used, the logs will be in bytes, but that creates a problem for the expect call since it won\u0027t match the line. I tried putting `b\u0027.*password:\u0027` and various other changes but they all didn\u0027t seem to work. I later found out that we could read port directly using pexpect, so I switched to that implementation.",
