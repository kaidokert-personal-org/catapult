      "message": "Hey Deep,\n\nI forgot to update one of the tests that referred to the `frame_times`. I\u0027ve updated tracing/tracing/metrics/rendering/rendering_metric_test.html to confirm that one of the tasks_per_frame is being calculated.\n\nI didn\u0027t make it too extensive as there is already cpu_utilization_test.html covering the inner workings.\n\nAny thoughts on the updated test?",

We\u0027re just counting the number of tasks. The method at this point is not super well named. Renaming it would be ideal, but if that\u0027s worth the effort, could you add a comment noting this strangeness?",
