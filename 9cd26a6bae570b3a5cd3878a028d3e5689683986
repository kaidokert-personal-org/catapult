      "message": "I don\u0027t believe this is safe to push to production yet but PTAL at what\u0027s here. I\u0027d like to change as little chromeperf dashboard code as possible so this approach \n- skips importing new client libraries and just goes for raw http POST\n- tries to hide any message format changes from the code that calls it (see the \u0027tags\u0027 formatting, but I\u0027m sure there are other parts I missed)\n\nRobbie: do you know if the v2 response types are compatible with whatever v1 returns? And should GAE\u0027s standard application auth headers work with buildbucket v2 if they worked with v1?\n\nJohn: do you have advice for testing a deployment of this change? e.g. is there an example cli command can I run to make chromeperf (or pinpoint) server execute these buildbucket calls, so I can verify in logs etc? I can probably figure it out eventually but if you have pointers it might speed me up.",
