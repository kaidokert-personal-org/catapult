      "message": "I thought about that, however, this code should not belong to the PossibleBrowser class since it\u0027s chrome-specific. To make that work would mean adding an extra PossibleChromeBrowser class, which does not exist yet.\n\nBut I\u0027ve heard you say that creating sub-classes just for code sharing is not the way to go. :)\n\nThat\u0027s why I made chrome_startup_args where most of the shared code is in fact placed, accessible via these two functions. Also follow up CLs will add code specific to each of android/desktop/cros. So they won\u0027t look too much alike in the end.",
