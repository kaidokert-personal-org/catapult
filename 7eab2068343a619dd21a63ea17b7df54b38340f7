The dashboard one comes from gitiles_service.CommitInfo(). Not sure what the right place in the code to handle the difference is; the pinpoint one seems massaged? gitiles doesn\u0027t provide a \u0027subject\u0027, for example.",

      "message": "+Dave: any idea how to deal with this in a consistent way across pinpoint and perf dashboard? I can adjust pinpoint\u0027s wrapper to CommitInfo but not sure if that\u0027s the best thing? And not sure if this will always be a \"Commit\" and not a \"Patch\" or other class?",
