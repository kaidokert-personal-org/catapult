It makes it unsustainable to even attempt to debug and/or test that combinatorial explosion, which is not necessary to support -- 90th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles are plenty to determine the shape of the tail. In fact, min, median, 90pct, 99pct, 99.9pct, and max can give you a good representation of the tail of the distribution and for things measuring latency (where the variance matters a lot), knowing the tail of the distribution is why you\u0027d even care about tracking these stats in the first place. :)\n\nIn this world of N:M (subscription to metrics) matching, we\u0027d have to do a projection of all the subscriptions applied to all the metrics that match, then apply the anomaly configs as a refinement per subscription to determine the amount of work we\u0027ll do when performing anomaly detection. Giving users arbitrary percentiles just gives us another axis of unbounded growth for very little gain.\n\nDoes that help?",

      "message": "Yes, because we need to know when we\u0027re filing issues for a subscription that has multiple matching alerts, whether we will need to file two separate issues or whether we\u0027ll even surface the subscription to non-internal users.\n\nConsider two subscriptions, a public one, and an internal-only one. If there are alerts that come up for internal-only bots but match a public subscription, we shouldn\u0027t match that subscription. Consequently if there is an alert for a public bot which matches both subscriptions, we should file two different issues (e.g. we should not let the publicly raised issues know that there are internal-only subscribers to those).\n\nDoes that make sense? I\u0027ve updated the comment in the proto with that description.",
