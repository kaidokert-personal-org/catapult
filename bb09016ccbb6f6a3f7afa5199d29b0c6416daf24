      "message": "Thank you Dirk! Do you mean rewrite test names in test expectations? (probably not). I have another CL escape test names in test expectations.\n\nIf you mean update the test files so that there is no such characters in test names, I would guess it will be difficult. Also we will be losing sync with upstream, which will probably cause all kinds of problems.\n\nIf we do want to make such a change, I think the change should be exported back to upstream. And I would expect owners of each test to make such a change.\n\nDo we have any rules of test names? we may need make this known to blink devs, and also get agreement at upstream.",
