The old behaviour would only match against histograms with the same name and no tir_label.",

Looking at https://chromeperf.appspot.com/report?sid\u003dbfecd6a30c8691a8d0c7a1ec048e309681a6776bfbb5d8a1fbbfcd36be543607\u0026start_rev\u003d551859\u0026end_rev\u003d563958, no individual pages move but the summary as a whole does (histograms summarizes slightly differently, this is known and was announced a while back).\n\nEthan, is that correct?",
