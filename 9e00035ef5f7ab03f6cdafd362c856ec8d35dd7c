      "message": "This is probably wrong. We probably don\u0027t want to divide ith display frame duration by the ith renderer frame interval. Let\u0027s say the page has OOPIFs. Then:\n\ndisplay:    F1    F2    F3    F4\nrenderer1:  I11   I12         I13\nrenderer2:        I21   I22   I23\n\nThen IntervalTime is something like [I11, I12, I13, I21, I22, I23], while frameSegments is [F1, F2, F3, F4]. We cannot assume the ith elements of the two lists correspond to each other.\n\nHere is my bigger question:\n\nOn android, surface refresh period is constant through out. So, we divide frame lengths by a single number. If this assumption is not correct on other platforms, could you please explain, preferably in the jack_count documentation at the beginning of the file:\n\n1- when refresh periods change, and\n2- what do we expect jank_count mean if the refresh period changes: e.g. if refresh period increases, is that a jank?",
