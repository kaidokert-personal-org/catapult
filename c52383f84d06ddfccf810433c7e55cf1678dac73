      "message": "After the alert group service go-live is done, the alert_group under dashboard/models will be removed. \n\nBut yes there is another model which will exist in both services.\n\nI did not use the existing model is because I don\u0027t want to create explicit dependencies between two services, especially those outside dashboard/. Ideally we should create a common contract (like proto) to share among all services which will access the same kind from datastore.\nOr we can update the current file structure to put the models/ in a common position. Then we will have more things to be decoupled.",
