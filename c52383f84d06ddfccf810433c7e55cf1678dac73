      "message": "After the alert group service go-live is done, the alert_group under dashboard/models will be removed. \n\nBut yes there is another model which will exist in both services.\n\nI did not use the existing model is because I don\u0027t want to create explicit dependencies between two services, especially those outside dashboard/. Ideally we should create a common contract (like proto) to share among all services which will access the same kind from datastore.\nOr we can update the current file structure to put the models/ in a common position. Then we will have more things to be decoupled.",

      "message": "If I unintentionally broke something in perf_issue_service by changing something defined in dashboard/dashboard/models/alert_group.py, that\u0027s a sure sign that the two pieces of code are coupled (regardless of explicit import statements), no? \n\nI don\u0027t see how making a separate copy of the existing model class removes that coupling in practice, but I do see how duplicate model classes make that coupling more difficult to detect and keep track of.\n\nThis approach has obvious downsides, but it may be a perfectly reasonable trade-off. Just so I understand what problem perf_issue_service is supposed to solve and why, is this the relevant design doc? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hwasDnCXCaPKdXxgDLQOEDwSJR-7dMvKBKKIMGzl_us/edit#heading\u003dh.lldt5vlxjhnx\n\n[Note: If this CL is a high a priority fix to un-block some other work, feel free to remove me as a reviewer and I\u0027ll try follow up later.]",
