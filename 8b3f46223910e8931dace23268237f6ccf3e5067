      "message": "Hey, so the test weirdness led me to finding a bug in how thread.html calculates segments.\n\nIt was using `slice.end` instead of `slice.duration` when calculating slice width.\n\nSo the test had:\n  Slice: start 7, end 7, duration 0\n  \nWhen counting slices present in the range 9-11, the above slice was being calculated as in the range as it was being treated effectively as:\n  Slice: start 7, end 14\n  \nThen weights were being apply to count it as a partial slice in the 9-11 range\n\nI\u0027ve updated the thread.html to use the duration instead. I\u0027ll kick off some pinpoints as I expect this will shift metrics",
