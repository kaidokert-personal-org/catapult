      "message": "Hey, so the test weirdness led me to finding a bug in how thread.html calculates segments.\n\nIt was using `slice.end` instead of `slice.duration` when calculating slice width.\n\nSo the test had:\n  Slice: start 7, end 7, duration 0\n  \nWhen counting slices present in the range 9-11, the above slice was being calculated as in the range as it was being treated effectively as:\n  Slice: start 7, end 14\n  \nThen weights were being apply to count it as a partial slice in the 9-11 range\n\nI\u0027ve updated the thread.html to use the duration instead. I\u0027ll kick off some pinpoints as I expect this will shift metrics",

      "message": "Wow that\u0027s... incredible. I\u0027m amazed we didn\u0027t notice this for so long. Thanks so much for finding and fixing this.\n\nAre the metric unit tests still passing? If you run catapult/bin/run_dev_server and then click on run unittests? I would have expected other unittests reliant on this code to break, so I\u0027m surprised it\u0027s passing on CQ (now I\u0027m doubting if the tests are even running on CQ), but may be all other tests had a similar high error tolerance.",
