      "message": "Despite the file name, this doesn\u0027t contain any tests, it just contains test helpers.\n\nI suggest renaming this to something like bisection_test_util, so that *_test.py is reserved for tests (except for run_test.py, of course, but I\u0027d like to fix that some day…).  Especially because this does define classes named *Test, like a module of unit tests does!  So initially I really did think this was defining tests.",
