      "message": "I just want to make sure I understand how you want this to act. \n\nIt currently acts as a hybrid, merging the old and new ways. This method will most likely eventually be moved completely into the constructor when we no longer use the old way anywhere. I just have it separate now because it is cleaner and I think will make the refactor easier. I can add a comment that lays this out clearly, since my intentions aren\u0027t obvious there.\n\nYou are suggesting that instead I have it completely overwrite anything done in the real constructor, making it a new constructor that the user can use? That would mean we would have to have the consumer (story_runner.py) know when to use which method. This means we have to convert it all over at once; and since it requires both chromium and catapult changes that might be tricky. \n\nOr are you suggesting that I just change the api to take different arguments and the hybrid approach is still ok to use?",
