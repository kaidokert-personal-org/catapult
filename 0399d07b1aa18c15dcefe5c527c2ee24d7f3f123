      "message": "This is an OK idea, but my feeling is that we\u0027d need to have this more granular -- i.e. only the \"important\" or \"stable\" measurements would be worth auto-triaging, and some stay as informational.\n\nMaybe this is better set in the `Pattern` message, and instead of a bool be a list of enums for the set of options?\n\nAn alternative design here would be to have a subscription-level set of options, and per-pattern override. I\u0027m thinking ahead about whether we want only certain metrics to be auto-triaged and auto-bisected, while some are only auto-triaged.",
