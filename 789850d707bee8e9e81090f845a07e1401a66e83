This CL unblocks pinpoint, but someone still needs to deploy the viewer on either pinpoint or perf dashboard and have pinpoint make use of it. I think it\u0027s important to be clear from a code archeology point of view. Some context from the code review guide, which I find super helpful:\nhttps://engdoc.corp.google.com/eng/doc/devguide/coding/review/developer/handling-comments.md?cl\u003dhead#code\n\"If a reviewer says that they don\u0027t understand something in your code, your first response should be to clarify the code itself. If the code can\u0027t be clarified, add a code comment that explains why the code is there. If a comment seems pointless, only then should your response be an explanation in Critique.\"\n\nHere, I\u0027m referring to the CL description rather than the code, but I think it still applies.",
