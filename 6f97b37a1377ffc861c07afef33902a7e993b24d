      "message": "Is there a strong reason for moving this out of story_runner.py? I would prefer to keep it there so most of the code for the run loops is in a single place; and this file can remain a small wrapper mostly defining the outside command line API.\n\nThat would also make it easier to review any changes in the code.",
