      "message": "Sorry for resurrecting this after over a year. I was wondering if there\u0027s a recommended way for the setup_fn to get access to commandline arguments. Specifically the setup_fn needs to know the verbosity to setup the logging basicConfig, so it needs access to runner.args.verbose. I was doing https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/catapult/+/2053063 when I realized it would hit this issue. I see that setup_fn gets a typ.runner._Child object. Presumably I could figure out how to get access to args.verbose from there, but it feels like the wrong solution since  the object starts with an underscore.",
