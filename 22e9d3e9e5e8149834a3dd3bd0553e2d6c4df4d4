      "message": "Is there a bug for this? Without more context (why do we need to change this UI?), I can at least agree that the overlapping obscured text in Wenbin\u0027s screenshots is an issue.  \n\nTo fix that, you might* want to wrap the `\u003ch2\u003e` and `\u003cp\u003e` in an intervening container `\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027job-type-heading\u0027\u003e`, between them and the containing `\u003ctemplate\u003e` elements (or just use one `\u003cdiv\u003e` for both `\u003ctemplates\u003e` and place it between `\u003cpaper-dialog\u003e` and the two `\u003ctemplate\u003e` elements.  Then you can set flexbox on the `job-type-heading` container \u0027\u003cdiv\u003e` with something like:\n\n```\n.job-type-heading {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n```\n\n*Note this is just one approach. As with most things in web layout there are many possible solutions. This suggestion uses CSS flexbox, which is more modern than display:block/inline techniques, but pinpoint already contains a mix of both approaches so pretty much anything that achieves the visual result should suffice.",
