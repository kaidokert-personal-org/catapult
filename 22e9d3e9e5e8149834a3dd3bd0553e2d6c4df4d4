      "message": "Is there a bug for this? Without more context (why do we need to change this UI?), I can at least agree that the overlapping obscured text in Wenbin\u0027s screenshots is an issue.  \n\nTo fix that, you might* want to wrap the `\u003ch2\u003e` and `\u003cp\u003e` in an intervening container `\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027job-type-heading\u0027\u003e`, between them and the containing `\u003ctemplate\u003e` elements (or just use one `\u003cdiv\u003e` for both `\u003ctemplates\u003e` and place it between `\u003cpaper-dialog\u003e` and the two `\u003ctemplate\u003e` elements.  Then you can set flexbox on the `job-type-heading` container \u0027\u003cdiv\u003e` with something like:\n\n```\n.job-type-heading {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n```\n\n*Note this is just one approach. As with most things in web layout there are many possible solutions. This suggestion uses CSS flexbox, which is more modern than display:block/inline techniques, but pinpoint already contains a mix of both approaches so pretty much anything that achieves the visual result should suffice.",

For instance, if I were looking at this form for the first time, I\u0027d believe that keyboard input focus was on this \"Attempt count\" field since it is the only input with a dark box around it.  Another false thing I might also assume based on this styling is that it\u0027s something I *have* to change since it seems like the form is directing my attention to it (\"Why is that input box with \u002710\u0027 in it highlighted? Is 10 an invalid value for that field?\" etc).",
