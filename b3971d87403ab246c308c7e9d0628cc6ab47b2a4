      "message": "+primiano I found out this code while cleaning up and removing the old legacy memory metrics. Appears to be using the tool in:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/tools/android/purge_ashmem\n\nIs this something that could/should be done for memory-infra? Or is just not relevant or not needed?\n\nIf not needed I could also kill that purge_ashmem on a follow up CL, I think this is the only client using that.",
