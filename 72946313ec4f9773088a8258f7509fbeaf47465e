      "message": "Recent versions of adb print socket information to stdout after successful forwarding is established. This leads to confusing messages like \u0027Unexpected output from \"adb forward\": 12345\u0027. The output itself may be useful to the calling site: for example, if the caller asks to forward any free tcp port (\"adb forward tcp:0 tcp:12345\"), this output will contain free port number adb chose to use for this forwarding. This is why I decided to return this output from the method.\n\nOn the other side, a call to \"forward --remove\" should not generate any output, this is why I moved this check for \"unexpected output\" down to ForwardRemove method and also applied it in new ReverseForwardRemove.",
