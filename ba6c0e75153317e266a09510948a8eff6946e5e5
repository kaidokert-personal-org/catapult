In your case, if you passed the string with the escape, it would literally try to find a directory called \"/var/log/chrome/Crash\\ Reports\" (with a slash before the space).\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/utils/cmd_helper.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d30\n[2]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/core/cros_interface.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d167",
