      "message": "I really think this should just be \u0027/var/log/chrome/Crash Reports/\u0027, then use a function (possibly [1]) to quote any special chars at the point where the arg is actually fed to a shell command.\n\nActually, I might be wrong, but looking at the implementation of FormSSHCommandLine, sounds like in local mode you need to quote args, i.e. replace \" \".join(args) with something like:\n\n    \u0027 \u0027.join(SingleQuote(str(c)) for c in args)\n\nbut otherwise there should be *no* quoting in the source string, because the args will be eventually fed back to Popen, with no shell involved at all. In your case, if you passed the string with the escape, it would literally try to find a directory called \"/var/log/chrome/Crash\\ Reports\" (with a slash before the space).\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/utils/cmd_helper.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d30\n[2]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/core/cros_interface.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d167",

      "message": "Not sure about running in local mode, but when run remotely, it ended up failing because it ended up using \"/var/log/chrome/Crash\" as the directory until I added the extra slash in. I think that it\u0027s because even though it\u0027s being fed into Popen, the device ends up evaluating it through a shell since it\u0027s being run over SSH.\n\nSingleQuoting all the given args when forming the SSH command doesn\u0027t work, as that ends up breaking some variables like this https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/core/cros_interface.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d271.\n\nDoubleQuoting also doesn\u0027t work because the semicolons here end up getting quoted and no longer working https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/telemetry/telemetry/core/cros_interface.py?rcl\u003d4eafd3bf8da0d61828310afff96c7b7044d1b178\u0026l\u003d301",
