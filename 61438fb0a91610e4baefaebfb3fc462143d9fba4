The added logic to look for packages that don\u0027t show up via \"pm list packages\" will be helpful regardless, particularly if more APKs end up having this weird behavior further down the line.",

      "message": "Static Shared Libraries (the Android platform feature Trichrome uses) report a package name with \"some unique number\" appended to the end, as a way of allowing multiple versions of the same package to be installed simultaneously. As I understand, it\u0027s an implementation detail that \"some unique number\" happens to be the versionCode. torne@ is the expert here, although he\u0027s documented some of this here: http://go/clank-webview-legacy/building-webview/trichrome-local-development (see \"special note about the installed library\").\n\nProbably best not to hardcode the trichrome packages.
