      "message": "Two (optional, feel free to irnogre these if they\u0027re difficult to change) nits on the box-shadow: \n\n- The vertical gap between the shadows and the top and botton edges of the element feels a bit odd. It looks like Gmail\u0027s implementation of this makes this look a bit better by sort of feathering the edges of the shadows out though I don\u0027t know how hard that is to implement. If it\u0027s tricky, I think it might look better to make the shadow flush against the vertical edges. \n- I think the shadow could potentially be a slightly lighter color and/or have a bit more blur to help the color spread out a bit more gradually. Looking at Material Design shadows ( https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html#elevation-in-material-design ), including ones on live apps such as Gmail shows that I think they tend to use a bit more blur. \n\n(Eventually we should add some sort of Chops standard shadow CSS so that we don\u0027t have to worry about tweaking shadows as much)",
