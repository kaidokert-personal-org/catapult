      "message": "Hi Rohan. I noticed that we pass --show-stdout when we run these tests, but the switch didn\u0027t do anything. This CL makes it do what it\u0027s advertised as doing. Have a look at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4142564 for tryruns with this CL applied. While there is a lot of redness, I think they\u0027re all pre-existing failures. WDYT? Thanks for taking a look.",

The fact that they\u0027re failing on cast_streaming_tests (on the same error: Error trying to read the debugging port) tells me something is missing in this CL for that particular browser.\n\nAt a minimum, those two suites should be green.",

      "message": "ah, yes. it was broken for the `--browser\u003dcast-streaming-shell` case. the problem was that the output of `session launch` and `session show` was being directed to the temp file, thereby interfering with the normal logging. i\u0027ve changed things so that the output of those two commands is either streamed to stdout (in case of `--show-stdout`) or piped to `/dev/null` (otherwise). cast_streaming_tests are passing now on sherlock and astro. wdyt?",
