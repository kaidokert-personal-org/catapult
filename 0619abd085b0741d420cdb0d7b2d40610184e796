      "message": "Hi Rohan. I noticed that we pass --show-stdout when we run these tests, but the switch didn\u0027t do anything. This CL makes it do what it\u0027s advertised as doing. Have a look at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4142564 for tryruns with this CL applied. While there is a lot of redness, I think they\u0027re all pre-existing failures. WDYT? Thanks for taking a look.",

      "message": "This is a great change, but you need to be wary about the redness: \n\nfuchsia-fyi-astro and fuchsia-fyi-sherlock are expected to be passing. The fact that they\u0027re failing on cast_streaming_tests (on the same error: Error trying to read the debugging port) tells me something is missing in this CL for that particular browser.\n\nAt a minimum, those two suites should be green.",

This is where it is read for the debugging port.\n\nNow it is:\n- browser process -\u003e symbolizer (optionally, and most of the time) -\u003e tee/cat. Output is now read.\n\nCan the debugging port be read at an earlier stage (preferably directly from the browser process)?",
