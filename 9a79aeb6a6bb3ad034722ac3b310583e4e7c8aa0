      "message": "Oh, I might know what this is: If your strip is from a fairly old Xcode (before 12.2), then it has a bug where it breaks the linker signature. So if you\u0027re running an older Xcode (or have a new version installed but never opened it so that it could install updated commandline tools), that\u0027d explain what we\u0027re seeing.",
