I think benchmarks that want this should explicitly request the umaMetric; otherwise it\u0027s hard to keep track of which benchmark depends on which metric.\n\nAlso, we want to switch to a behavior where metrics complain if the events they need are not found in the trace. This prevents issues where a metric that *is* expected silently disappears and stops being reported.",
