      "message": "Looks like this is in the wrong indentation level. This story_run object will end up being the last story_run object of all the ones in the for loop. I think this should go to the finally block in line 242, probably after \"results.DidRunPage(story)\"\n\nHow do we add test to prevent this bug? Maybe a smoke test that create 3 stories, each repeat 2 times which paired with a dummy test that just wait for 100 ms, then the smoke test ensure that we get 6 story duration, each greater than 100ms?",
