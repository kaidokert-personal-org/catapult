      "message": "I am not really sure if this is something that\u0027s allowed or not. If not, any guidance where this should go?\n\nI attempted writing a generic codesearch-linkifier, where the project/embedder (i.e. chrome, or other projects that use trace-viewer ... not sure what the right term is) can inject the codesearch URL (or the factory that generates the codesearch URL), and have this code use that here. But I couldn\u0027t find a good way of doing that (other than what is in here). I looked at chrome_config.html, hoping there could be something there, but failed to find anything similar there that I could follow. As someone not familiar with polymer (or web-development, really), guidance would be most helpful!",
