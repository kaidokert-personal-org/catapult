I don\u0027t think there is a generic index value that makes sense because every iteration would write to the same index. \n\nFortunately, AFAIK, job_state is the only caller of attempt.py\u0027s scheduleWork(), but I\u0027ll run a bisection on staging tomorrow just to make sure nothing goes wrong.",
