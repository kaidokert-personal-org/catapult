      "message": "PTAL, I\u0027ve switched alerts to allocated_objects_size for everything by default, but also kept v8 on effective_size.\n\nShould we add something like that for other allocators too? or just v8?\n\nAlso double checking: for system health purposes we\u0027re asked to report the metrics below in ANDROID_ALERTS. Would that be sufficient? Or should we also alert on effective_size (in addition to allocated_objects_size) for mobile?",
