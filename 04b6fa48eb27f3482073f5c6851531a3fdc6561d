To start, note the implementation of \nthis method only barely depends on \"self\".\n\nI saw John\u0027s comment on having code for checking the exit status on communicate(). I believe however I would rather declare this an \"advanced feature\", just let the StartShell method return the Popen object, and pass the responsibility of properly dealing with that object to the callers.\n\nWe could try to create some DevicePopen object, but I believe that will just increase the complexity with very little pay off.\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure.
