      "message": "That\u0027s a good catch.\n\nCurrently because we are still going through Chromeperf, the existing workflow will still use Chromeperf\u0027s SA to create a bug, and also add the same SA in \u0027collaborators\u0027 so that we can update the bug in the future even if the bug is moved to another component. I believe it is the case even when the bug is created from UI by a user.\n\nAdding Skia\u0027s SA here require some works as we need a way from Chromeperf to tell which SA (from different instances) is creating the bug. I will create a task for it.",
