      "message": "Awesome! Thanks for doing this. I think it would be great to implement this (including the entire for-loop) as a new device_utils method [1], e.g.: device.ChangeOwner(paths, owner, recursive\u003dTrue)\n\nWhat do you think? If so you can also add some test to [2] that will run in real devices on a few places.\n\n+jbudorick FYI\n\n[1]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/device_utils.py\n[2]: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/device_utils_devicetest.py",
