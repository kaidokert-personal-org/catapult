      "message": "Also, Andrew mentioned that adb might be already compressing pushes so there might be double-compression going on. I am not sure how to validate that. When I was looking that up I found adb changelog that says _pull_ turned compression to _off_ by default an some point but I\u0027m not sure about push and what\u0027s the distribution of the adb versions in the fleet.\n\nGenerally speaking though, it\u0027s difficult for me to imagine a case where compressing the file would actually matter. Pushing low-entropy files over a slow connection?.. Would that be an actual scenario that can happen nowadays?",

I thought the main motivation for zipping was to push everything in one adb call as opposed to actually making the files smaller. I think it\u0027s also likely the case that large files constitute the majority of bytes, and that large files are already compressed in some way.\n\nAndroid did add automatic compression for adb push:\nhttps://b.corp.google.com/issues/150827486\n\nI think it works only on devices whose adb server supports it though, and I don\u0027t know which version of android that is.",

      "message": "Thanks for linking the bug, Andrew. lz4 sounds like the perfect option for this. If there was an easy way to flip deflate to lz4 I\u0027d do that, even with double compression that would be blazing fast. Single-threaded deflate, not so much apparently.. Also note how the *de*compression step on the phone also took significantly longer time (60s deflate vs 30s store). I personally am very tempted to just flip the compression off and see if anyone complains. I\u0027m happy to take all the blame ~:}",
