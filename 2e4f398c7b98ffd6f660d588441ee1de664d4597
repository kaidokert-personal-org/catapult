      "message": "Also, Andrew mentioned that adb might be already compressing pushes so there might be double-compression going on. I am not sure how to validate that. When I was looking that up I found adb changelog that says _pull_ turned compression to _off_ by default an some point but I\u0027m not sure about push and what\u0027s the distribution of the adb versions in the fleet.\n\nGenerally speaking though, it\u0027s difficult for me to imagine a case where compressing the file would actually matter. Pushing low-entropy files over a slow connection?.. Would that be an actual scenario that can happen nowadays?",
