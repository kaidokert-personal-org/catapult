      "message": "LGTM\n\nIf you\u0027re wondering why I\u0027ve been so incredibly slow, it\u0027s largely because I need to figure out how to create a remote Linux instance (don\u0027t think I can manage all steps from my corp laptop, though maybe I\u0027m mistaken), muck with AppEngine, manually test, muck with GCP. And I haven\u0027t been focused much on net/ stuff lately.  Likely not a huge investment, unless I run into any issues, in which case I could end up sinking half a day into learning enough about tools to do it - tools I\u0027ll likely never use for anything but this.",
