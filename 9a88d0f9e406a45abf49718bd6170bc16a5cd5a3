      "message": "That is a good point. I think we\u0027ve been sloppy about this in the same way about all other binaries listed in this file.\n\nWhat about adding a binary_dependencies.md pointing to sources for this, and maybe small build instructions if needed? Or just add an extra key to this dict pointing to e.g. a gitiles url? Either way, we can start doing this for trace processor; then get clients of other tools to do the same for theirs.\n\n+jbudorick what are your thoughts? As you also mentioned maybe getting rid of binary manager in the future, we should do something that is compatible with cipd practices.",
