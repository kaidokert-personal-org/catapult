The issue with staging is that it\u0027s difficult for it to finish a bisection with multiple culprits because there are multiple transient issues that can prevent a job from finishing. The longer something runs, the less likely it is for the job to finish. \n\nI was able to confirm that this code is able to run a bisection all the way through, so let\u0027s land this and see if it works on production? Might be more convenient this way. ",
