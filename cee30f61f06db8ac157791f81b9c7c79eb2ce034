      "message": "Looking at the history, this seems to have been added for some legacy startup benchmark to switch between warm/cold starts. But that mechanism is no longer used by the new startup benchmarks or the (renderer) cache_temperature feature; and assuming the browser is always started \"cold\" is probably the best for all benchmarks.\n\nLeaving this as-is for now. Will try to flip to True everywhere on a follow up CL (so we can easily revert if my assumptions are wrong).",
