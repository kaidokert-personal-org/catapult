      "message": "This ones just sorting the data by its memory used (the y-axis). I thought that I\u0027d do the cumulative frequency plot in another CL because I thought that correctly binning the values may take a little bit of thought (although once the data is processed it will be sufficient to just use the linePlot function, so that CL will really just be creating the processing function to compute the cumulative frequencies).\nI just did a quick search and it looks like d3 will handle calculating the bin sizes actually.",

I was thinking that the data would be sorted into buckets and we would count the frequency of data falling into each bucket before computing the cumulative frequency (although actually, thinking about it now, I see that wouldn\u0027t actually be necessary).",
