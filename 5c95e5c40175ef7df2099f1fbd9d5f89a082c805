If so, I can make Descriptor generate bot aliases from bot_configurations so that I don\u0027t need to update bot_aliases whenever bot_configurations changes.",

      "message": "In order to avoid infinite recursion, I would need to move most of the rest of this method into a new method and call that in a loop, but if we ever want to support measurement or test case aliases, we\u0027d need to split that function again. It seems simpler to me to handle a single list throughout a single method split into a few clear sections. This method was already handling a list of test paths at the end for _ref, and callers are handling lists of test paths, so this CL just extends the list-handling back to the beginning of the method for consistency.\nBut I can see how having multiple methods that handle single strings would be simpler from another perspective, so I can refactor that if you want.",
