      "message": "This script is responsible for installing the APKs onto device, after the build is already done. So both apk_name and additional_apk_name are filenames in the build output. For bundles, apk_name is actually a script placed in out/Release/bin directory by the build, and it has the same name as the build target. We have some algorithm to find apk_name, so it doesn\u0027t require path, but additional_apk_name is assumed to be in the same location as apk_name, unless a path is given. In this case, trichrome_chrome_google_bundle is in bin, while TrichromeLibraryGoogle.apk is in apks, so a path is needed for the latter.",
