      "message": "modernizer updates this file because of zip here, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s needed because this zip is being used as an iterator, so is the import `six.moves import zip` necessary? Most of the files in this CL share the same properties (zip is used as an iterator, import statement is brought in but doesn\u0027t do anything). I wanna know if it\u0027s worth cutting the import statements.\n\nzip python 2 and 3 differences: https://realpython.com/python-zip-function/#:~:text\u003dComparing%20zip%28%29%20in%20Python%203%20and%202,-Python%27s%20zip%28%29%20function",
