The only real difference between them is that CrOS and Android need to pull the dumps to the host. WDYT about adding a PullDumps() method to BrowserBackend that is a no-op by default, but overridden by CrOS/Android implementations, and then move the logic into BrowserBackend?",

I don\u0027t think the current logic does this, as we\u0027re adding the offset (which is device_time - host_time), when I think we should be subtracting it.\n\nConcrete example:\n\nThe device is 1 second ahead of the host, so the offset is 1.\n\nWe create two files at the same time (we\u0027ll use 10 as an example), one on the host, and one on the device. This means that the host\u0027s file has an mtime of 10, while the device\u0027s has an mtime of 11.\n\nIf we were to pull the file onto the host, we\u0027d want its mtime to be 10, which is (device_mtime - offset). However, with the current logic, we\u0027d get 12 from (device_mtime + offset).\n\nJust want to be sure everyone agrees that the current logic is wrong before changing it here + in CrOS\u0027 implementation.",
