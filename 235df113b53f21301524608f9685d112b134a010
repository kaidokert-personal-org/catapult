      "message": "It acts as a (fairly hacky but common) way to deep clone JSON objects in js. We turn it into a string so that JSON.parse can be used, which will parse the string a new (cloned) JSON object. However, I just released that we have the underscore library imported which probably has it\u0027s own deep clone method so maybe that would be better?",

      "message": "Also, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s clear here but the objects have to be deep cloned because the state will be mutated in the vue components so if we push the raw states then they will be mutated to reflect the current state rather than the history. Do you think that needs a comment?",
