      "message": "It does look like this has been some activity around -T lately (https://github.com/landley/toybox/commits/master/toys/posix/ps.c), so we\u0027ll likely be able to put an upper bound on this sooner or later.\n\nGiven that, my inclination would be to keep the current interface -- i.e., not split ListThreadsForProcess() back out -- and do the piped shell command + regex logic to avoid pulling 100KB. It\u0027d likely be best to pull that logic into a separate helper function (_GetPsOutputForO?) just to keep the rest of GetPsOutput readable.\n\nI do think that this is something that devil should know how to do as opposed to telemetry. I strongly prefer that we have devil handle android version-specific quirks.",
