We\u0027re getting Nexus 9 to have a reasonable bot config here, right?  With the goal to get that new bot green-ish or closer to being able to run tests?\n\nOne good rule of thumb that I learned from Tommy is:\nState how it works now, what gets changed, and why the change is being made.\n\nThanks for this work!",
