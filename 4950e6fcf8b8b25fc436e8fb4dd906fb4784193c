After a week check if the metrics look close. (they match locally. just thought it is safer).\n3. Remove the non rcs metrics for compile / parse / optimize.\n\nI was planning to retain _rcs suffix for metrics that are computed based on rcs. For example v8:compile_rcs etc., Let me know if this sounds Ok.",
