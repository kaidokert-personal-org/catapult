      "message": "I think it\u0027s not a good idea to send rows here. Look at the number of rows being processed at a time by this _AddRowsFromData function in the Logs (will dm you the link). It\u0027s just a few. This is because it\u0027s grouping rows by common parent_test. The rows sent already have a common parent_test so it defeats the whole purpose of grouping in skia_bridge and will cause way more files being written (You will have 1 datapoint per file essentially). We should send all the rows once or send them in bigger batches.",
