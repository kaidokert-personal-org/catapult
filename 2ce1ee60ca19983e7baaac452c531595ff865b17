      "message": "I think this needs to be a bit more robust; this will not work correctly if one version number is a prefix of another (ok, it will be a long time before that), but also if there are several versions for the same milestone this will pick a random one.\n\nInstead let\u0027s try to make this more strict by trying to parse the version number (i.e. expect 4 digits separated by \u0027.\u0027) and, if there are several versions for the same milestone, return the one for the later version.\n\nWe should also start thinking about adding some tests. Up to you if you want to do it on this CL or a follow up.",
