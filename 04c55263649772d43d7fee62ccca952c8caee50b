      "message": "I had to give the PRESUBMIT the capability to build the proto as well. You should be able to run the presubmit at any time (straight after a clone) and it should always work. In order for it to always work, it needs to generate all protos that are used by code that the presubmit looks at (like generic_set in this case).\n\nI didn\u0027t find anything magical that builds the sheriff config protos either for the presubmit, so I assume I have to do this.\n\nWe could save some duplication by importing build_steps here and having it be the source of truth for how the protoc command should look like. I\u0027m unsure, but I think it makes reasonable sense to have the presubmit import build_steps.",
