      "message": "Current Pinpoint doesn\u0027t care about whether the difference is an improvement or regression, it outputs top three as culprits (example bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1463453#c6, the two signs of the two culprits in comment 6 is different, so that I think one is in the regression direction while the other is in the improvement direction). I think if the one is in the improvement direction, then we may not need to take care of it further.\n\nThe calculation of diff is based on the code here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/catapult/dashboard/dashboard/pinpoint/models/job_bug_update.py;l\u003d335 There values align with the values displayed on the Pinpoint update comment, e.g. Parse-Background:duration: 34.72 â†’ 210.1 (+175.3) (+504.9%)\n\nI am happy to remove this logic and go with what Pinpoint does right now (may remove the highlighted codes). What do you think about it? Many thanks!!",
