      "message": "Changing the ordering of the stories sounds like a really good idea, but it is also a bit scary, since probably a lot of stuff depends on this ordering. For example, sharding bases which stories run on which bots based on this ordering, so therefore this change will cause a discontinuity in bot soft affinity. We need to think carefully about whether this change is a good idea given that the discontinuity in soft affinity will cause a bunch of false-positive improvements and regressions.",
