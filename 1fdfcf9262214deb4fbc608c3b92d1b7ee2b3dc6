      "message": "Should there be a \"TODO\" somewhere to give this \"auto_explore\" a better name? As discussed in the bugs this is more like distinguishing between functional/performance jobs.\n\nThis reads like: \"please explore between HEAD and HEAD+patch\", which sounds really strange.\n\nSemi-related me wondering: are both of those \"HEAD\"s turned somewhere into a git hash atomically? Or could there be a race where each resolves to a different nearby hash?",
