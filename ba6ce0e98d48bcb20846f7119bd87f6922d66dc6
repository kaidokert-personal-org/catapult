      "message": "The two (nav start and net request) can be quite far from each other :( After navigation start the network service has to start, the HTTP cache has to make a disk roundtrip to determine whether a network request has to be made. There was an internal discussion about implementing a \u0027more proper\u0027 time to network request:\ngo/2018-time-to-network-request-discussion.\n\nIn other words, the navigation_start_time will reflect some point in time defined in terms of chrome \u0027architecture\u0027 and not defined purely as the end-user benefit, which can lead to spending time optimizing for things that are not essential. It is not bad to have a few metrics like this (after all, \"messageloop_start_time\" is like this - it was better than anything at catching startup regressions).\n\nSimilarly, content_start_time is something that is made farther from being user-focused by having the architectural constraint built into it. It can be informative though, so I am hesitant, but I would really like to have our top-level metrics be more user-focused.\n\nA possible avenue is to name these extra metrics \u0027experimental_*\u0027, avoid alerting on them, etc. How long do we want to maintain them? They did not simplify the code :)\n\nThe proposal for navigation_commit_time looks actually quite cool to me. I did not think that it\u0027d be useful in lab-controlled environments because I got used to the world of having the time to network request. Given that it is missing now, perhaps time-to-commit would be a good replacement for it, it is tightly linked to the request start (when in the lab), right?\n\nSo, to summarize, my proposal would be to:\n1. have navigation_commit_time as a toplevel metric that we will optimize for, alerted\n2. perhaps have experimental_content_start_time and experimental_navigation_start_time for some time to be able to understand the startup sequence better, and then perhaps stop worrying?",

      "message": "Sorry if I wasn\u0027t clear in the description: the intention is to make all of these new metrics purely diagnostic metrics that we would never alert on. The motivation is that we can move a bunch of these independently through scheduling changes and we\u0027d like to observe what kind of correlation that has with the user-visible top-level metrics. I agree that navigation_start_time is especially not very meaningful in isolation, but still potentially a useful signal to have internally.\n\nI\u0027ve now renamed these to experimental_* to make their expected use more obvious (except navigation_commit_time as you mentioned).",
