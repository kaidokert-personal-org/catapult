      "message": "Dave, I wanted to use the same logic as in pinpoint:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/dashboard/dashboard/pinpoint/models/quest/read_value.py?rcl\u003d237fb2a03b4b525d829b169d7061b79917262797\u0026l\u003d281\n\nHowever the job state returned by the API does not include the bot dimensions, I think it only includes the arguments used to create the job, but not those after being resolved/expanded by pinpoint?\n\nAnyway, I believe this should work for the current set of bot configurations what we have.",

      "message": "That\u0027s true, the API was written for display to the user. Since the resolved arguments are hidden from the user, they\u0027re not included.\n\nIt should be possible to add a separate field containing the configuration\u0027s arguments. Or maybe the best thing to do in this specific case would be for Pinpoint to send the perf results path in the quest details. Filed https://crbug.com/897350 for that.",
