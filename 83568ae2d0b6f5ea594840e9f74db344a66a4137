We\u0027re already in a timeout thread by the time we get here, so we won\u0027t create another one w/ adb_timeout (https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/decorators.py?rcl\u003d994bb1389b1d8ad8333b0de5d7a524ec38fed99f\u0026l\u003d50). The timeout passed to GetCmdStatusAndOutputWithTimeout will be whatever timeout was passed to RunShellCommand (https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/sdk/adb_wrapper.py?rcl\u003d994bb1389b1d8ad8333b0de5d7a524ec38fed99f\u0026l\u003d265).\n\nIf you want to have that terminate before the timeout thread kills it, I think you\u0027d instead want to change adb_wrapper to always pass a timeout to GetCmdStatusAndOutputWithTimeout that\u0027s slightly shorter than the current timeout thread group\u0027s remaining time. I think you\u0027d want to do that all the time rather than exposing it as an option.",
