      "message": "This won\u0027t actually do what you want. We\u0027re already in a timeout thread by the time we get here, so we won\u0027t create another one w/ adb_timeout (https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/decorators.py?rcl\u003d994bb1389b1d8ad8333b0de5d7a524ec38fed99f\u0026l\u003d50). The timeout passed to GetCmdStatusAndOutputWithTimeout will be whatever timeout was passed to RunShellCommand (https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/catapult/devil/devil/android/sdk/adb_wrapper.py?rcl\u003d994bb1389b1d8ad8333b0de5d7a524ec38fed99f\u0026l\u003d265).\n\nIf you want to have that terminate before the timeout thread kills it, I think you\u0027d instead want to change adb_wrapper to always pass a timeout to GetCmdStatusAndOutputWithTimeout that\u0027s slightly shorter than the current timeout thread group\u0027s remaining time. I think you\u0027d want to do that all the time rather than exposing it as an option.",

      "message": "Always using a smaller timeout will break some tests that run just under the timeout specified via existing parameter, therefore we\u0027d want some opt-in mechanism here. Implementation-wise, I agree this won\u0027t work, so we\u0027d need to propagate this down to the GetCmdStatusAndtOutputWithTimeout. Not a very nice way to do it, but I see no better alternative.\n\nI\u0027ve also changed adb_timeout into a boolean parameter and hard-coded the timeout value as it prevents users from making these two mistakes:\n - using adb_timeout \u003e timeout: timeout overrides adb_timeout and always logs are always lost\n - timeout-adb_timeout is too small: introduces race conditions",
