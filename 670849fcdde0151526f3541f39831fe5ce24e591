      "message": "I think these flags should be handled by _GetPsOutput rather than passed here, with something like:\n\n  _GetPsOutput(None, pids\u003d[pid], threads\u003dTrue)\n\nIt looks like the ps interface varies across version (yay). In toolbox (\u003cM, iirc) -t shows thread info and -T does nothing. In toybox (\u003e\u003dM), -t selects by TTY and -T shows thread info. I\u0027d prefer the logic for handling the difference be done in exactly one place.",
