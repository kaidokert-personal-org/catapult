      "message": "I\u0027m positive there should be a way of generating this on demand via GN. Can we explore that instead of checking in the generated protobuf code? I ask this because we don\u0027t do this for the Dashboard nor Pinpoint (we use Makefiles to generate them on demand), and it would be a shame if we started checking in generated code.\n\nSomething like: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/+/master/protobuf/proto_library.gni#121 ?",
