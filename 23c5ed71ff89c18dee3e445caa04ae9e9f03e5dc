      "message": "Looks like results_set is what \"memorize\" the state of the results, so the full_results does turn out to be corerct.\n\nFor the test_set, the reason I make a copy is because we does mutate the test_set below (pop out test that have been run from the test, \"test_inputs.pop(0)\" at line 550). So after a single run, the test_set is empty \u0026 the next repeat run doesn\u0027t result in tests being executed. I think we have a few choices here:\n1) Make the test_set.copy() here\n2) Modify the execution code below to not pop up the test already run\n3) Change test_set to a test_list or test_dict \u0026 enable it to store duplicated instances of tests to be run\n\nLemme know which option you prefer (or any other option)",
