      "message": "I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary. The source of the timestamps is the same for each window (SurfaceFlinger\u0027s composite start time), only SurfaceFlinger associates them with a window if that window was updated in that particular frame.\n\nSo the code here essentially includes a SurfaceFlinger composite event if any of these windows was updated in that frame. Which is what we want I think. In the benchmark each surface flinger frame corresponds to a chrome frame (even if only a subset of the windows were updated by chrome in that frame).",
