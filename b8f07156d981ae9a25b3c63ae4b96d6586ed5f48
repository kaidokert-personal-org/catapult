      "message": "The Bug and Revisions columns just contain data that is not very long, and the icon still takes up space even when the table is not sorting by that column, pushing the column-head label to the right.\nI changed it to hide the icon when the table is not sorting by that column, but now the label jumps around when you change the sortColumn.\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Ahh, I see. That makes sense; thanks for explaining. I think leaving the gap for the icon makes sense. Perhaps adding more space to table headers or cells might help? The more general UX concern I have here is that, at first glance, I found myself a bit confused at which table headers mapped to which columns. (specifically, Bugs vs Revisions was confusing to me at first).",
