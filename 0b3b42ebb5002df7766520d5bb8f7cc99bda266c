      "message": "That was my first idea, but then I thought it would look pretty redundant in the future to have the \"TBM\" both in the method name and all the values e.g.:\n\n  options.SetTimelineBasedMetrics([\n    \u0027tbmv3:some_metric\u0027,\n    \u0027tbmv3:another_metric\u0027,\n    ...\n  ])\n\nBut maybe that\u0027s not too bad and more clear? Happy to go with what everyone thinks it\u0027s best.",
