I can easily imagine a test that creates 100 tabs but only measure the performance of the active tab.",

      "message": "This is the correct place for this, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s correct to add this flag to Telemetry at all. While it\u0027s certainly useful for certain tests, like you mentioned, there might be performance tests that rely on Chrome\u0027s normal tab backgrounding behavior. If that\u0027s the case, it would be better to just add this flag as an extra browser arg to the tests that actually need it.\n\n+johnchen who I believe is more familiar with the perf side of things for comment.",
