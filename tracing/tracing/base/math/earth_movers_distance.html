    * Earth Mover's distance (EMD), also known as the Wasserstein distance,
    * is used to compare distributions.
    * The Earth Mover's Distance between two distributions is proportional
    * to the minimum amount of work required to change one distribution into
    * the other.
    * One unit of work in this case is equal to the amount of work necessary
    * to move one unit of 'dirt' by one unit of distance.
    * When the two distributions are non-negative and are of the same size
    * (contain same amount of dirt), there exists a closed form formula for
    * the EMD between these two distributions. The EMD in that case is equal
    * to the area between the CDFs of the two distributions.
