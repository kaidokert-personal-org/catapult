As you can see the BUILd.gn file has been modified. I had to do this to let me upload due to the presubmit script outputting this:\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\nRunning presubmit upload checks ...\nERROR:root:Diff found. Please rerun generate_telemetry_build.py.\n\n** Presubmit ERRORS **\nBUILD.gn needs to be re-generated. Please run /usr/local/google/home/anthonyalridge/catapult/generate_telemetry_build.py and include the changes in this CL\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\nAs far as I can tell this is related to changes introduced here (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/1186132) and here ( https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/1188386).\n\nBased on the presubmit script message it seems like it\u0027s okay to do this but I\u0027m hesitant as I\u0027m not sure why this was necessary (it doesn\u0027t seem to add/remove anything it just reorders the existing stuff, so far as I can tell).\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\n\nI tried creating a new branch and uploading a random change (just a comment in a random, non v8 tools file) and I still had to generate the BUILD.gn so it\u0027s not a rebase/merge thing so far as I can tell.",
