      "message": "execution from sdcard seems to have been possible while android was using `fuse`, but before `noexec,nodev,nosuid` have been introduced. the trio above appears to be the default since at least api level 21 (lollipop)\n\nfwiw, before then, the underlying filesystem (fuse is not a filesystem by itself, it\u0027s more of a proxy) was `noexec`, which makes sense (permitting execution off sdcard would make a device vulnerable)\n\n---\n\nsince the `Unzip.java` doesn\u0027t set any permissions, i would expect it to follow whatever `umask` mandates, but i\u0027m not sure whether java enoforces default mask by itself. if it does, we can look into setting these permissions directly with `unzip.java` - would that be acceptable?",

      "message": "I tried running chromium CQ bots with this rolled in (kinda neat that you can point DEPS to a code review):\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4853177?tab\u003dchecks\n\nLooks like crashpad_tests breaks with it when trying to pull a file. One guess is that in the working case, a prior PushChangedFiles() call chmod\u0027ed the file it\u0027s trying to pull because it lives in a directory where `chmod -R` was called on it. That\u0027s just speculation though.\n\nAnyways... house of cards!",

      "message": "hmm i just attempted this and it worked well.. i can\u0027t find any logcat for the crashpad_tests that would explain what is happening, but perhaps the test did not run at all. how do we run native tests? do we deploy them somewhere (say, \u0027/data\u0027) and run from there? do we use the same mechanism to push them?\n\nthis issue has made feel miserable (pushing 3gb over network onto test devices is no fun) for a week now. if you can offer any guidance, i would really appreciate it.\n\nmeantime i\u0027ll just keep digging, but i fear i won\u0027t be able to spend much more time on this.",
