      "message": "I tried running chromium CQ bots with this rolled in (kinda neat that you can point DEPS to a code review):\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4853177?tab\u003dchecks\n\nLooks like crashpad_tests breaks with it when trying to pull a file. One guess is that in the working case, a prior PushChangedFiles() call chmod\u0027ed the file it\u0027s trying to pull because it lives in a directory where `chmod -R` was called on it. That\u0027s just speculation though.\n\nAnyways... house of cards!",
