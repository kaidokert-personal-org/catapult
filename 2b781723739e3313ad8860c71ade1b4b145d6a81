The shell would remove the quotes before passing them to Chrome.\n\nWhen you are putting arguments in a Python list, the arguments are passed directly to Chrome, bypassing shell. In this case, Chrome will see the quotes, and likely gets confused.\n\nPlease double check that the quotes are really necessary.",
