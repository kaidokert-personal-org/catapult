      "message": "the Deployment section in the oncall rotation includes some manual copy/paste steps that I stumbled on this morning; I think we can automate at least the \"figure out which version to update each service to\" part with something like the command in this CL.\n\nNote: The catapult repo doesn\u0027t support Go development very well AFAICT. I don\u0027t know if CI will even verify that this code builds.  I thought about putting this in skia/buildbot, but it really doesn\u0027t belong there since it\u0027s so specific to problems that only catapult/dashboard has.",
