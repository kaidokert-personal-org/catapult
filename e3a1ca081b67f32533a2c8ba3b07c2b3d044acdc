      "message": "This adds diag to all histograms in the set. If some of those histograms came from TBM2, then that would be unnecessary, but not problematic. If some of those histograms came from different stories, or different repeats of the same story, then this could cause problems.\nWould it be safer to store the Diagnostic objects on the TelemetryInfo, and copy them to new Histograms as they are added in AddHistogram?",

      "message": "I fail to see how keeping it on the TelemetryInfo makes a difference.  Doesn\u0027t every histogram go through AddHistogram?  That means that we will still be adding it to all histograms in the set.\n\nHow often does TelemetryInfo change?  I thought it was populated once and it remained static throughout the run of the benchmark.",
