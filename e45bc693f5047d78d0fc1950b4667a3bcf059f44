I assume that\u0027s not what you want to happen.\n\nThis might work better (note the use of backticks, not single quotes) if you just want to append a single formatted string: \n```\nannotation.a_bot_id.push(`... and ${annotation.a_bot_id.length - 3} more bots`)\n```\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals",
