However, I updated the wrong requirement.txt file in the CL:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/catapult/+/5880336\n\nwhich should update the requirements.txt under perf_issue_service.\n\nI\u0027ll have a CL to fix this so that perf-issue-service should be the only service needs to be updated, and I\u0027ll do it on my rotation.",
