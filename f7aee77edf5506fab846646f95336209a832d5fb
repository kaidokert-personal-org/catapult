      "message": "A couple of other ideas that are floating around:\n\n- Don\u0027t tag anything as ReleaseBlock-Stable yet. Instead, we should experiment with a non-blocking tag, then promote to blocking once we\u0027re convinced the tagged bugs are useful.\n- Don\u0027t tag bugs when they\u0027re filed. Instead, tag them when Pinpoint finishes running, and only if Pinpoint finds a culprit. That is, don\u0027t tag runs that get automatically closed as WontFix due to no culprit being found.",
