      "message": "Seems like this works in 1 case, but doesn\u0027t if the regression is in the opposite direction. Ie. if you have 2 differences in the range, and the means are [5, 10] \u003d\u003e b - a \u003d\u003e 5, [10, 100] \u003d\u003e 90, this will correctly choose the [10, 100] delta as the largest.\n\nBut if you have [100, 10] \u003d\u003e -90, [10, 5] \u003d\u003e -5 as the means, it will choose -5 which seems wrong.\n\nChoosing the largest absolute change might improve things? Also maybe you could get a hint about the \"right\" direction by comparing the direction of the change between the first and last revision in the job.",

      "message": "Thanks. This was mainly based on my brief search across bugs: I saw people flagging negative deltas as actual improvements, and decided it was the most common case.\n\nI\u0027ll update the code to compare absolute values (PTAL, my Python is rusty) when sorting to keep the actual numbers handy. Once we add (don\u0027t know how yet) the notion of good/bad into the intent, we would make use of it here and in other places.",
