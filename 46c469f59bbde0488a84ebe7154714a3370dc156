      "message": "Seems like this works in 1 case, but doesn\u0027t if the regression is in the opposite direction. Ie. if you have 2 differences in the range, and the means are [5, 10] \u003d\u003e b - a \u003d\u003e 5, [10, 100] \u003d\u003e 90, this will correctly choose the [10, 100] delta as the largest.\n\nBut if you have [100, 10] \u003d\u003e -90, [10, 5] \u003d\u003e -5 as the means, it will choose -5 which seems wrong.\n\nChoosing the largest absolute change might improve things? Also maybe you could get a hint about the \"right\" direction by comparing the direction of the change between the first and last revision in the job.",
