I thought you didn\u0027t (at least not for the GPU tests). Currently that support isn\u0027t implemented in TYP, so we\u0027d have to add it.\n\nThird, are you planning to have both parameters indefinitely, or are you planning to remove \u0027expectations_file\u0027 once you\u0027ve updated callers?",

      "message": "I plan on removing expectations_file. Ned made a suggestion that I rename expectations_file to expectations_files. However if I made that change then I would have to make a change in src/tools/perf/chrome_telemetry_build/chromium_config.py because it uses the old parameter. I made a new optional parameter, expectations_files, and I will make a change in the chrome source file so that it uses this new parameter. And then I will remove the old parameter.a",
