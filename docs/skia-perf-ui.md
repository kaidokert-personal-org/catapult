The Browser Performance Engprod team is working on deprecating the chromeperf dashboard for viewing graphs and charts. This is replaced by skia-perf instances created for our data, and comes with a rich set of tools that give more analytical ability and a modern experience.

Below we describe a few features that will allow you to get equivalent features on skia-perf to the features available on chromeperf.

1. Query

2. Multiple plots on a graph

3. View Anomalies

4. Kick off Pinpoint Bisection Jobs
